Rather, it depends on the specific legal and contractual set-up if an\nopen-end investment fund without own legal personality may be considered\nan obligor under Article 178(1) CRR or not.\nAs a general criterion, the legal counterparty of a credit contract is to be\nconsidered as the obligor of the credit obligations arising from that credit\n\n2 of 24\n\ncontract for the purposes of the definition of default in accordance with\nArticle 178 CRR. Notwithstanding this, where the sole assessment of the\ndefault risk of the asset management company acting as the legal\ncounterparty of a credit contract on behalf of the fund does not reflect the\nactual default risk of a credit obligation, the fund may instead be considered\nas the obligor of such credit obligation, provided that the following\nconditions are met:\nThe asset management company as legal counterparty that has\nentered into the credit contract on behalf of the fund is, by law or by\ncontract, legally protected against a non-performance of the fund with\nregard to all payments arising from that credit contract. As a result,\nall such payments are solely related to the fund, and the management\ncompany that acts on behalf of the fund as legal counterparty is not\nliable for any payments related to credit obligations entered into for\nthe account of the fund.\nThe fund is, by law or by contract, legally protected against an\ninsolvency of the asset management company, i.e. in case of an\ninsolvency of the asset management company all due payments under\nthe credit contract are legally protected from such insolvency and it is\nlegally ensured that all those payments will be made without undue\ndelay despite of the insolvency of the asset management company.\nFurthermore, an insolvency of the asset management company is\nunlikely to trigger any indications of unlikeliness to pay at fund level\nleading to the identification of a default according to Article 178 (1)\n(a) CRR pursuant to the definition of default applied by an institution\nto respective credit obligations.\nWhere the fund is considered as obligor according to the abovementioned\nconditions, the assignment of the exposure to a rating grade or pool should\nbe carried out at fund level.\nThis Q&A concerns solely the interpretation of Article 178 of the CRR and\nthe Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article\n178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013” (EBA/GL/2016/07) and the assignment\nof IRB exposures to a rating grade or pool consistent with this interpretation.\nAs such, it does not apply to exposures in the form of units or shares in a\nCIU, nor where the CRR requires a treatment as such exposures, in\nparticular for minimum value commitments that meet all the conditions set\nout in Article 132c(3) CRR. Where an exposure to a CIU is assigned to the\nexposure class of items representing securitisation positions according to\nArticle 112(m) or Article 147(1)(f) CRR, the securitisation framework applies.\nThis Q&A does not interpret nor can be used for the purpose of interpreting\nor applying any regulations related to asset management companies and\nfunds.",

There should not be any\nagreement according to which a disproportionate contribution leads to a\npreferential treatment in case the reserve is dissolved.\nd) The contribution should be evidenced as fully paid up at the time of its\nrealisation, under the same conditions as share capital, and the contribution\nshould not be funded directly or indirectly by the institution. Contributions in\nkind should fulfil the criteria specified in Q&A 3636.\ne) There should not be any direct or indirect economic benefits of any kind to\nthe contributor or any other person for the contribution made (e.g.\ndividends, interest, remuneration, servicing cost, etc).\nf) The provisions governing or documentation formalising the contribution\nshould indicate expressly that, in accordance with the last subparagraph of\nArticle 26(1) CRR, the amounts contributed are available to the institution\nfor unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these\noccur.\n\n5 of 24\n\ng) Contributions should be classified as equity for the purposes of\ndetermining balance sheet insolvency, where applicable under national\ninsolvency law.\nh) Contributions should be accounted for as reserves within equity, in\naccordance with the applicable accounting framework.\ni) The institution should provide sufficient disclosure of such an item in its\npublic accounts.\nj) The contributor should not be entitled to any right on the profits and\nreserves in any situation including in the event of the institution’s insolvency\nor liquidation.\nk) All the above requirements should be documented in a legal form similar\nto the one used for increases of CET1 instruments taking into account the\nlocal legal framework. For contributions in kind, similar documentation can\nalso include an independent auditor’s valuation.\nl) Any reclassification of the contribution to another reserve and/or\ndistribution should be subject to prior consultation with the competent\nauthority.",

According to Article 193(4) CRR, the\ncash received from the transferee under the repurchase transaction is\nto be treated as collateral for this exposure. In case of using the\nfinancial collateral comprehensive method (FCCM) for recognising the\ncredit risk mitigation by this cash collateral, the third sub-paragraph\nof Article 111(1) CRR requires increasing the exposure value of the\nsecurities or commodities sold to the transferee by the volatility\nadjustment appropriate to such securities or commodities.\nThe exposure constituted by the securities or commodities to be\nrepurchased exists for the transferor already before the repurchase\ndate. This applies even if they don’t remain on the transferor’s balance\nsheet during the repurchase transaction because, due to the\nrepurchase commitment, it is outside the direct control of the\ntransferor to avoid the repurchase of these securities or commodities\nanymore.\n1. Depending on the applicable accounting framework, if the transferred\nsecurities or commodities do not remain on the balance sheet before\nrepurchased, Annex I CRR requires assigning the off-balance sheet\nexposure to the full risk category (according to point (1)(g)), and\nArticle 111(1)(a) CRR determines the exposure value as 100% of the\nnominal value of the securities or commodities after reduction of\nspecific credit risk adjustments and amounts deducted in accordance\nwith Article 36(1)(m) CRR. In contrast, if they remain on the balance\nsheet, the exposure value is the accounting value after the\nadjustments as specified by the first sentence of Article 111(1) CRR.\n2. The cash received from the transferee when selling the securities or\ncommodities cannot be recognised as collateral for the exposure\narising from these securities or commodities, because the transferor is\nnot entitled to retain any of the received cash in case of a default\nevent on the securities or a reduction in value of the commodities, but\n\n11 of 35\n\nis obliged to repurchase them at the specified price irrespective of any\nreduction in value of these securities or commodities. Thus, the\nprinciple according to Article 194(4) CRR for recognition of the\nreceived cash as funded credit protection is not met.\nThe transferee also has an exposure constituted by the repurchase\ntransaction, which is an exposure to the transferor.\nThe exposure to the transferor is constituted by the transferor’s\nobligation to repurchase the transferred securities on a future date at\na specified price. Under the standardised approach for credit risk,\nArticle 111(2) CRR permits a choice for determining the exposure\nvalue of the repurchase transaction, either in accordance with\nChapter 6 or with Chapter 4 of Part Three, Title II CRR.\n1. In case of applying the methods for counterparty credit risk in\naccordance with Chapter 6, the transferee’s counterparty credit risk\nexposure arises from the commitment of the transferor to repurchase\nthe securities or commodities.\n2. In case of applying the methods for credit risk mitigation in\naccordance with Chapter 4, the exposure value is determined by the\ntransferor’s payment obligation for the specified price. According to\nArticle 193(4) CRR, the securities or commodities received from the\ntransferor under the repurchase transaction are to be treated as\ncollateral for this exposure.\nIn contrast to the transferor’s perspective, the transferred securities and\ncommodities only constitute an exposure for the transferee if recorded on\nthe transferee’s balance sheet until repurchase (which may depend on\nwhether the transferee is obliged or merely entitled to resell them, e.g. in\ncase the applicable accounting framework treats repurchase transactions in\nline with Article 12 of Directive 86/635/EEC), whereas as off-balance sheet\nitem they do not constitute an exposure because the transferor is obliged to\nrepurchase them at a specified price irrespective of any deterioration in\nvalue.",

For those prudently valued software assets,\na specific prudential treatment has been recently introduced to the\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 241/2014 (RTS), which, under\nArticle 13 a), envisages an amortization for prudential purposes over a\nperiod of maximum three years.\nMoreover, Article 37(a) CRR requires that ‘the amount to be deducted shall\nbe reduced by the amount of associated deferred tax liabilities that would be\nextinguished if the intangible assets became impaired or were derecognised\nunder the applicable accounting framework’.\nThe interplay between Article 13a RTS and Article 37(a) CRR has been\nrecently clarified by Q&A 5567. The answer specifies that for prudently\nvalued software the amount to be deducted from CET1 items – as calculated\naccording to the mentioned Article 13 a) - shall be reduced only by the\ncorresponding portion of the associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) and\nnot by the full amount of DTLs related to the software assets at stake.\nFrom the example provided by the submitter, it is understood that the\npositive tax effect mentioned is the one associated with the ordinary fiscal\ndeductibility of the amortization of the software during its residual life. As it\nis assumed that the accounting amortization of each period will be entirely\ndeductible for tax purposes (implying that the tax and accounting value of\nthe assets will be aligned over the period) no temporary differences (neither\nDTLs nor DTAs) will arise for the case presented.\nTherefore, the tax deductibility of the accounting amortization will only\nimpact the determination of the current tax of each year that will be lower\nthan the amount would have been determined without the accounting\namortization and its fiscal deduction.\nThus, the net effect reflected in the P&L of each year due to the accounting\namortization will be equal to the value of the amortization (recorded as an\nexpense in each year) minus the tax saving that will emerge due to its tax\ndeductibility. In formula: Net effect P&L = Accounting amortization in each\nyear * (1- tax rate).\nAs the positive effect of the tax deductibility is already considered in the\ncalculation of the profit and loss of the period, positively affecting the CET1,\nthe same effect shall not be considered in the calculation of the prudential\ndeduction of prudently valued software. This in fact would constitute a\ndouble counting of the positive effects of the tax saving that would artificially\ninflate the CET1.\nTherefore, software assets shall not be netted of the “upfront amount of\namortization that will be tax deductible”.\nOn the contrary, should the positive tax effect mentioned by the submitter\nrefer to the DTLs associated with the intangible assets (instead of the\n\n13 of 24\n\ncurrent tax of each year) the clarifications provided by Q&A 5567 remain\nvalid.",

The value of the capital\ninstruments that will have to be deducted in that case is the accounting\nvalue of the instruments that are counted towards regulatory own funds.\nThe value of the bank’s investment (i.e., the loan) will depend on the\ncollateral and this is regardless of the process followed for its realisation.\nSince pursuant to Article 4(1)(126) CRR ‘synthetic holding’ means an\ninvestment by an institution in a financial instrument the value of which is\ndirectly linked to the value of the capital instruments issued by a financial\nsector entity, pledged shares qualify as synthetic holdings given that the\nvalue of the loan would be linked to the value of the own capital instrument;\nthis is because either the fair value of the loan which incorporates credit risk\nwould depend on the recovery cash-flows from the pledged shares in the\ncase of a potential future default or the loan loss provision (esp. under IFRS\n9) , so there is a direct link that is relevant for own funds purposes. Because\nof the link between the value of the loan and the value of the pledged shares,\nthe loan granted by the institution (together with the shares pledged as\ncollateral) should be seen as a financial instrument the value of which is\ndirectly linked to the value of the (pledged) shares issued by the institution.\nTherefore granting such a loan should be seen as an investment by the\ninstitution in a financial instrument the value of which is directly linked to\nthe value of the capital instruments issued by the institution and as such a\n‘synthetic holding’ within the meaning of Article 4(126) CRR.\nMoreover, Article 36(1)(f) CRR requires deduction for the following items:\n“direct, indirect and synthetic holdings by an institution of own Common\nEquity Tier 1 instruments, including own Common Equity Tier 1 instruments\nthat an institution is under an actual or contingent obligation to purchase by\nvirtue of an existing contractual obligation;”. In some legal systems, a\ncontingent obligation to purchase may exist in case the debtor defaults (so\nwhen it does not comply with the existing contractual obligation to repay the\nloan) and the other methods for enforcing the collateral are not successful.\nAspects that are not part of the question raised cannot be considered in the\nanswer, hence the answer is limited to the specific case of pledged own\nshares.",

A put option which is subject to the conditions described in the\nbackground does not qualify as short position for the purposes of Article 45\nCRR even though the fulfilment of the conditions depends only on the holder\nof the put option.\nDue to the nature of these conditions, the put option described in the\nbackground does not provide an adequate hedge for entity A shares, and\ntherefore should not be allowed to net the exposure. This is because there\nmay be instances where, even if the bank is willing to fulfil the conditions, it\nmay not be possible to do so. For example, in a downturn event, where entity\nA shares fall below a certain threshold, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) would\nnot be initiated. Under this scenario, the bank would still have the exposure\nto entity A, but would not be able to exercise its right to sell (i.e. the hedge\nwould not be effective). Additionally, short positions and their use for netting\npurposes shall always be carefully scrutinized, to ensure that they provide a\ngenuine hedge for the value of the long position.\n2. According to Article 36(1)(h) and (i) CRR, an institution shall deduct the\napplicable amount of direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of CET 1\ninstruments of financial sector entities. Article 45 CRR allows for institutions\nto make the deductions required under Article 36(1)(h) and (i) calculating\nthe holdings on the basis of the net long position provided that the\nconditions in Article 45 are met.\nArticle 15f(1)(b)(ii) of the RTS on Own Funds substantiates Article 36(1) CRR\nby defining that the amount of synthetic holdings, other than call options,\nbooked in the non-trading book to be deducted from CET 1 shall be the\nnominal or notional amount, as applicable.\n3. Any netting of holdings of CET1 instruments with a short position\naccording to Article 45 CRR constitutes a credit risk exposure to the\ncounterparty of the short position, for which the exposure value is\n\n7 of 30\n\ndetermined by the full amount that is no longer deducted due to netting with\nthe short position.\nThe CRR does not treat the holding of a CET1 instrument as solely\nconstituting an equity exposure but already as a total loss due to the\ndeduction, similarly to a first loss tranche in a securitisation. Not deducting\nan amount of such holdings of CET1 instruments due to netting with a short\nposition according to Article 45 CRR effectively treats the non-deducted\namount as if the total loss has been replaced by a receivable, i.e. as if the\nCET1 instrument had been sold and the payment had not already been\nreceived from the counterparty of the short position. Thus, the payment still\noutstanding is equivalent to a loan to this counterparty over the full\napplicable amount of the put option that has been considered in the\ncalculation of the net long position.",

This value is determined as the difference between the\nexposure amount calculated without recognising that collateral and the\nexposure amount recognising that collateral, in accordance with Article 223\n\n28 of 30\n\nof that Regulation.\n\nQuestion 2:\nFor exposures arising from SFTs included in a master netting agreement, an\ninstitution that applies the approaches set out in Article 220 or Article 221 of\nRegulation (EU) No 575/2013 to calculate the exposure value has to apply\nthe substitution approach for the same reasons stated in the response to\nQuestion 1.\nUnder these approaches, for each eligible collateral securing an exposure\narising from SFTs included in a master netting agreement, the portion of the\nexposure to be assigned to the third party (i.e. collateral issuer) rather than\nto the client is the value of that collateral recognised as reducing the\nexposure to the client for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements.\nThis value is determined as the difference between the exposure amount\ncalculated without recognising that collateral (all other things being equal)\nand the exposure amount calculated recognising that collateral (all other\nthings being equal).\n\nQuestion 3:\nYes, when an institution uses the approach set out in Section 6 of Chapter 6\nof Title II of Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (i.e. the IMM) to\ncalculate the own funds requirement for counterparty credit risk for those\nexposures, the substitution approach is applicable to those exposures.\nUnder this approach, for each eligible collateral securing an exposure\narising from SFTs included in a master netting agreement, the portion of the\nexposure to be assigned to the third party (i.e. collateral issuer) rather than\nto the client is the value of that collateral recognised as reducing the\nexposure to the client for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements.\nThis value is determined as the difference between the exposure amount\ncalculated without recognising that collateral (all other things being equal)\nand the exposure amount calculated recognising that collateral (all other\nthings being equal).\n\nQuestion 4:\nArticle 399(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 requires an institution that\nhas used a credit risk mitigation technique to calculate own funds\nrequirements for credit risk to also use that technique in the calculation of\nexposures under the large exposure rules. Therefore, the only situation in\nwhich an institution would be allowed to not recognise the use of a credit\n\n29 of 30\n\nrisk mitigation technique under large exposure rules, is when it would not\nrecognise it when calculating own funds requirements for credit risk.\n\nQuestion 5:\nNo. Based on the combined reading of Articles 399(1) and 403(1) of\nRegulation (EU) No 575/2013, an institution is only required to apply the\nsubstitution approach where it has used a credit mitigation technique to\ncalculate own funds requirements for credit risk.\nDisclaimer:\nThe answers clarify provisions already contained in the applicable\nlegislation.

For determining the maximum recognised percentage under the\nstandardised approach or the applicable LGD* and the required\ncollateralisation levels for the secured parts of IRB exposures, the value to\nbe used is either the market value or, in those Member States that have laid\ndown rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in\nstatutory or regulatory provisions, the mortgage lending value to derive in a\nfirst step the maximum amount which may receive the privileged risk weight\ndedicated to the recognition of immovable property collateral, which may, as\napplicable, in a second step be reduced to take in particular account of any\nprior claims on the immovable property.\n1. Standardised approach (SA)\nUnder the SA for credit risk, the conditions in Article 124(1) for considering\nan exposure or part of an exposure as fully secured by mortgages on\nimmovable property and in Articles 125(2) and 126(2) CRR for considering\n\n10 of 29\n\nan exposure or part of an exposure as fully and completely secured by\nmortgages on residential or commercial immovable properties, respectively,\nexclusively refer to (i) the market value of the immovable property or (ii) the\nmortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous\ncriteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or\nregulatory provisions. Consequently, no other value is recognised for this\npurpose.\nFor the same purpose, the conditions in Articles 125(2)(c) and 126(2)(c) CRR\nrequire that the valuation rules set out in Article 229(1) CRR are met, where\nthe last sub-paragraph requires that the market value or mortgage lending\nvalue shall be reduced as appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring\nrequired under Article 208(3) CRR and to take account of any prior claims on\nthe immovable property.\nAs a consequence, for determining the part of the loan to which the risk\nweight for the fully and completely secured part is assigned, the maximum\nrecognised percentage of the market value or mortgage lending value in\nthose Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the\nassessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory\nprovisions, according to Article 125(2)(d) or 126(2)(d) CRR applies to the\nmarket value or mortgage lending value, as applicable, after being reduced,\nas appropriate, to take account of any prior claims on the immovable\nproperty or of the results of the monitoring required under Article 208(3)\nCRR.\nTherefore, only the calculation provided as alternative 2 in the background\non the question leads to the correct result.\n2. IRB Approach\nUnder the IRB Approach, for the purpose of recognising immovable property\ncollateral in accordance with Article 199(1)(a) CRR, the criteria in Article\n230 CRR for determining the applicable LGD* and the required\ncollateralisation levels for the secured parts of exposures refer to the value\nof the collateral.\nFor this purpose, Article 229(1) CRR requires the value of the collateral to be\nthe market value or or mortgage lending value, similarly to how this is\nspecified in the SA.\nAlso in line with the SA, the last sub-paragraph of Article 229(1) CRR\nrequires that the market value or mortgage lending value shall be reduced\nas appropriate to reflect the results of the monitoring required under Article\n208(3) CRR and to take account of any prior claims on the immovable\nproperty.\nAs a consequence, for determining the applicable LGD* and the required\ncollateralisation levels for the secured parts of exposures, the value of\n\n11 of 29\n\ncollateral to be used for this purpose is the market value or mortgage\nlending value, as applicable, after being reduced, as appropriate, to take in\nparticular account of any prior claims on the immovable property.",

It includes therefore all other types of\n\n10 of 33\n\nequity holdings, which are subject to risk weighting, with the exception of\nexposures not deducted from the capital but risk weighted at 250% in\naccordance with Article 48(4) of the CRR or at 370% in accordance with\nArticle 471 of the CRR.\n\nRegarding the denominator of the materiality threshold, own funds are to be\ncomputed as stated in CRR Part II of the CRR. “The average over the\npreceding year” mentioned in Article 150(2) should be determined as the\naverage of the 4 last quarters (this includes the quarter that ends at the\nrespective reporting date for in relation to which the calculation is done), in\norder to restrict the effects of the volatility per quarter.\nAs specified in 150(1) CRR, PPU can only be applied if an institution has\nreceived prior permission by CA. For the exposures described in 150(1)(c),\nthe CA may authorise the use of PPU for exposures that meet the\n“immateriality of exposures” criterion, which for the equity exposure class is\nbased on an average over the preceding year, as set out in Article 150 (2).\nThe CRR does not provide for the application of a phase-in period, when the\nthreshold is reached. Therefore, if the equity holdings are above the 10% or\nthe 5% threshold, as applicable , the institution shall use the IRB Approach\nfor the equity exposure class laid down in point (e) of Article 147(2).\nFor the purposes of the capital requirements on a consolidated level, the\nmateriality ratio has to be calculated on such consolidated level.

In\nparticular, the classification depends on the purpose of the customer’s\nindemnity payment obligation and on whether the customer’s indemnity\npayment obligation has already been triggered under the customer’s\ncontract.\nIn case the first condition is met (i.e. the predefined event occurs), the\nguarantee is to be considered a full risk item in accordance to point 1(a) of\nAnnex I CRR, as in such case the guarantee would be for the good payment\nof the triggered payment obligation of the customer to the third party, which\nwould have the character of credit substitutes.\nThe same applies in case the first condition is not met, to the extent that the\ncustomer’s indemnity payment obligation serves as protection for a credit\nrisk exposure to a third party different from the customer, because in this\ncase the institution provides a counter-guarantee for the customer’s payment\nobligation, under a guarantee for the credit risk exposure to the third party.\nIn contrast, in case the first condition is not met and the un-triggered\nindemnity payment obligation serves for providing compensation for the\ncustomer’s failure to perform under a contract that is not related to credit\nrisk - such as the obligations of a building contractor or a tenant described in\nthe background on the question - the institution’s guarantee for the\ncustomer’s indemnity payment obligation does not (yet) expose the\n\n13 of 33\n\ninstitution in full to the credit risk of the customer and therefore does not\nhave the character of a credit substitute. The assignment to one of the nonfull risk categories in Annex I CRR therefore depends on whether the\nadditional qualifying criteria set out therein are met.\nIn particular, where the institution provides a guarantee for the customer’s\nindemnity payment obligation, this scenario does not qualify as an undrawn\ncredit facility for performance guarantees, and cannot qualify as low risk\nitem. On the other hand, for warranties (in particular performance bonds) or\nother guarantees not having the character of credit substitutes to classify as\nmedium/low risk paragraph (3)(a)(ii) of Annex I CRR requires them to be\ntrade finance off-balance sheet items.\nFor this reason, unless they are undrawn credit facilities or trade finance offbalance sheet items or fit a different, more specific categorisation, the\nclassification for the described guarantees could be as:\nmedium risk item, specifically as other items also carrying medium\nrisk and as communicated to EBA, set out in paragraph (2)(b)(iv) of\nAnnex I CRR; or as\nmedium-low risk item, specifically as other items also carrying\nmedium/low risk and as communicated to EBA, set out in paragraph\n3(b)(ii).",
