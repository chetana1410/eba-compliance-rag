**3.** Where undertakings are related within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU, competent authorities shall determine how consolidation is to be carried out.


**4.** Participations in institutions and financial institutions managed by an undertaking included in the consolidation together with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidation shall be consolidated proportionally according to the share of capital held, where the liability of those undertakings is limited to the share of the capital they hold.


**5.** In the case of participations or capital ties other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4, competent authorities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out. In particular, they may permit or require the use of the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis.

- (a)where, in the opinion of the competent authorities, an institution exercises a significant influence over one or more institutions or financial institutions, but without holding a participation or other capital ties in those institutions; and
- (b)where two or more institutions or financial institutions are placed under single management other than pursuant to a contract, clauses of their memoranda or articles of association.In particular, competent authorities may permit or require the use of the method provided for in Article 22(7), (8) and (9) of Directive 2013/34/EU.


**7.** Where an institution has a subsidiary which is an undertaking other than an institution or a financial institution or holds a participation in such an undertaking, it shall apply the equity method to that subsidiary or participation.

- (a)the institution does not already apply the equity method on 28 December 2020;
- (b)it would be unduly burdensome to apply the equity method or the equity method does not adequately reflect the risks that the undertaking referred to in the first subparagraph poses to the institution; and
- (c)the method applied does not result in full or proportional consolidation of that undertaking.


**8.** Competent authorities may require full or proportional consolidation of a subsidiary or an undertaking in which an institution holds a participation where that subsidiary or undertaking is not an institution or a financial institution and where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the undertaking is not an insurance undertaking, a third-country insurance undertaking, a reinsurance undertaking, a third-country reinsurance undertaking, an insurance holding company or an undertaking excluded from the scope of Directive 2009/138/EC in accordance with Article 4 of that Directive;
- (b)there is a substantial risk that the institution decides to provide financial support to that undertaking in stressed conditions, in the absence of, or in excess of any contractual obligations to provide such support.


**9.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify conditions in accordance with which consolidation shall be carried out in the cases referred to in paragraphs 3 to 6 and paragraph 8.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**10.** EBA shall submit a report to the Commission by 10 July 2025 on the completeness and appropriateness of the definitions and provisions of this Regulation concerning the supervision of all types of risks to which institutions are exposed at a consolidated level. EBA shall assess in particular any possible remaining discrepancies in those definitions and provisions alongside their interaction with the applicable accounting framework, and any remaining aspect that might pose unintended constraints to a consolidated supervision that is comprehensive and adaptable to new sources or types of risks or structures that might lead to regulatory arbitrage. EBA shall update its report at least once every two years.In light of EBA’s findings, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal to make adjustments to the relevant definitions or the scope of prudential consolidation.

- (a)where the undertaking concerned is situated in a third country where there are legal impediments to the transfer of the necessary information;
- (b)where the undertaking concerned is of negligible interest only with respect to the objectives of monitoring institutions;
- (c)where, in the opinion of the competent authorities responsible for exercising supervision on a consolidated basis, the consolidation of the financial situation of the undertaking concerned would be inappropriate or misleading as far as the objectives of the supervision of institutions are concerned.


**3.** Where, in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 and point (b) of paragraph 2, several undertakings meet the criteria set out therein, they shall nevertheless be included in the consolidation where collectively they are of non-negligible interest with respect to the specified objectives.

The equivalence of that extended aggregated calculation shall be verified by an external auditor and in particular that the multiple use of elements eligible for the calculation of own funds as well as any inappropriate creation of own funds between the members of the institutional protection scheme is eliminated in the calculation. The consolidated balance sheet or the extended aggregated calculation shall be reported to the competent authorities with the frequency set out in the implementing technical standards referred to in Article 430(7);(v)the institutions included in an institutional protection scheme meet together on a consolidated or extended aggregated basis the requirements laid down in Article 92 and carry out reporting of compliance with those requirements in accordance with Article 430.

**5.** The standardised total risk exposure amount shall be calculated as the sum of paragraph 4, points (a) to (g), after having taken into account paragraph 6 and the following requirements:
- (a)the risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk, including counterparty credit risk, and dilution risk, referred to in paragraph 4, point (a), and for counterparty credit risk arising from the trading book business of the institution as referred to in point (g) of that paragraph shall be calculated without using any of the following approaches:(i)the internal model approach for master netting agreements set out in Article 221;(ii)the Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Title II, Chapter 3;(iii)the Securitisation Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Articles 258, 259 and 260 and the Internal Assessment Approach set out in Article 265;(iv)the Internal Model Method set out in Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6;

- (c)the own funds requirements for all non-trading book business activities of an institution that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk referred to in paragraph 4, point (c), of this Article shall be calculated without using the alternative internal model approach set out in Title IV, Chapter 1b.


**6.** The following provisions shall apply to the calculations of the un-floored total risk exposure amount referred to in paragraph 4 and of the standardised total risk exposure amount referred to in paragraph 5:
- (a)the own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 4, points (d), (e) and (f), shall include those arising from all business activities of an institution;

- (b)reporting lines for the department accountable for the valuation process that are clear and independent of the front office, which shall ultimately be to the management body.


**3.** Institutions shall revalue trading book positions at fair value at least on a daily basis. Changes in the value of those positions shall be reported in the profit and loss account of the institution.


**4.** Institutions shall mark their trading book positions and non-trading book positions measured at fair value to market whenever possible, including when applying the relevant capital treatment to those positions.


**5.** When marking to market, an institution shall use the more prudent side of bid and offer unless the institution can close out at mid market. Where institutions make use of this derogation, they shall every six months inform their competent authorities of the positions concerned and furnish evidence that they can close out at mid-market.


**6.** Where marking to market is not possible, institutions shall conservatively mark to model their positions and portfolios, including when calculating own funds requirements for positions in the trading book and positions measured at fair value in the non-trading book.


**7.** Institutions shall comply with the following requirements when marking to model:
- (a)senior management shall be aware of the elements of the trading book or of other fair-valued positions which are subject to mark to model and shall understand the materiality of the uncertainty thereby created in the reporting of the risk/performance of the business;
- (b)institutions shall source market inputs, where possible, in line with market prices, and shall assess the appropriateness of the market inputs of the particular position being valued and the parameters of the model on a frequent basis;
- (c)where available, institutions shall use valuation methodologies which are accepted market practice for particular financial instruments or commodities;
- (d)where the model is developed by the institution itself, it shall be based on appropriate assumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process;
- (e)institutions shall have in place formal change control procedures and shall hold a secure copy of the model and use it periodically to check valuations;
- (f)risk management shall be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to reflect those in the valuation output; and
- (g)institutions' models shall be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of their performance, which shall include assessing the continued appropriateness of assumptions, analysis of profit and loss versus risk factors, and comparison of actual close out values to model outputs.For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, the model shall be developed or approved independently of the trading desks and shall be independently tested, including validation of the mathematics, assumptions and software implementation.


**8.** Institutions shall perform independent price verification in addition to daily marking to market or marking to model. Verification of market prices and model inputs shall be performed by a person or unit independent from persons or units that benefit from the trading book, at least monthly, or more frequently depending on the nature of the market or trading activity. Where independent pricing sources are not available or pricing sources are more subjective, prudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be appropriate.


**9.** Institutions shall establish and maintain procedures for considering valuation adjustments.


**10.** Institutions shall formally consider the following valuation adjustments: unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, market price uncertainty, early termination, investing and funding costs, future administrative costs and, where relevant, model risk.


**11.** Institutions shall establish and maintain procedures for calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of any less liquid positions, which can in particular arise from market events or institution-related situations such as concentrated positions and/or positions for which the originally intended holding period has been exceeded. Institutions shall, where necessary, make such adjustments in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial reporting purposes and shall design such adjustments to reflect the illiquidity of the position. Under those procedures, institutions shall consider several factors when determining whether a valuation adjustment is necessary for less liquid positions. Those factors include the following:
- (a)the additional amount of time it would take to hedge out the position or the risks within the position beyond the liquidity horizons that have been assigned to the risk factors of the position in accordance with Article 325bd;
- (b)the volatility and average of bid/offer spreads;
- (c)the availability of market quotes (number and identity of market makers) and the volatility and average of trading volumes including trading volumes during periods of market stress;
- (d)market concentrations;
- (e)the ageing of positions;
- (f)the extent to which valuation relies on marking-to-model;
- (g)the impact of other model risks.


**12.** When using third party valuations or marking to model, institutions shall consider whether to apply a valuation adjustment. In addition, institutions shall consider the need to establish adjustments for less liquid positions and on an ongoing basis review their continued suitability. Institutions shall also explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments relating to the uncertainty of parameter inputs used by models.


**13.** With regard to complex products, including securitisation exposures and n-th-to-default credit derivatives, institutions shall explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect the model risk associated with using a possibly incorrect valuation methodology and the model risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly incorrect) calibration parameters in the valuation model.


**14.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which the requirements of Article 105 shall be applied for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 July 2013.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

**4a.** For the purposes of paragraphs 3 and 4, the credit or equity derivative transaction entered into by an institution may be composed of multiple transactions with multiple eligible third party protection providers, provided that the resulting aggregated transaction meets the conditions set out in those paragraphs.


**5.** Where an institution hedges non-trading book interest rate risk exposures using an interest rate risk position booked in its trading book, that interest rate risk position shall be considered to be an internal hedge to assess the interest rate risk arising from non-trading book positions in accordance with Articles 84 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU where the following conditions are met:
- (a)for calculating the own funds requirements for market risk using the approaches referred to in Article 325(1), points (a), (b) and (c), the position has been assigned to a separate portfolio from the other trading book positions, the business strategy of which is solely dedicated to managing and mitigating the market risk of internal hedges of interest rate risk exposure;
- (b)for calculating the own funds requirements for market risk using the approach referred to in Article 325(1), point (b), the position has been assigned to a trading desk the business strategy of which is solely dedicated to managing and mitigating the market risk of internal hedges of interest rate risk exposure;
- (c)the institution has fully documented how the position mitigates the interest rate risk arising from non-trading book positions for the purposes of the requirements laid down in Articles 84 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU.

**7.** Where an institution hedges a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk exposure using a derivative instrument entered into with its trading book, the position in that derivative instrument shall be recognised as an internal hedge for the CVA risk exposure for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 383 or 384, where the following conditions are met:
- (a)the derivative position is recognised as an eligible hedge in accordance with Article 386;
- (b)where the derivative position is subject to any of the requirements set out in Article 325c(2), point (b) or (c), or in Article 325e(1), point (c), the institution perfectly offsets the market risk of that derivative position by entering into opposite positions with third parties.The opposite trading book position of the internal hedge recognised in accordance with the first subparagraph shall be included in the institution’s trading book to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk.


# Article 107

**Approaches to credit risk**

*Article 107*


**1.** Institutions shall apply either the Standardised Approach provided for in Chapter 2 or, where permitted by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 143, the Internal Ratings Based Approach provided for in Chapter 3 to calculate their risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g).


**2.** For trade exposures and for default fund contributions to a central counterparty, institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Chapter 6, Section 9, to calculate their risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g). For all other types of exposures to a central counterparty, institutions shall treat those exposures as follows:
- (a)as exposures to an institution for other types of exposures to a qualifying CCP;

*Article 108*


**1.** For an exposure to which an institution applies the Standardised Approach under Chapter 2 or applies the IRB Approach under Chapter 3 but without using its own estimates of LGD under Article 143, the institution may take into account the effect of funded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g) and, where relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 36(1), point (d), and Article 62, point (d).


**2.** For an exposure to which an institution applies the IRB Approach by using its own estimates of LGD under Article 143, the institution may take into account the effect of funded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 3 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g), and, where relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 36(1), point (d), and Article 62, point (d).


**3.** Where an institution applies the IRB Approach by using its own estimates of LGD under Article 143 for both the original exposure and for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider, the institution may take into account the effect of unfunded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 3 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g), and, where relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 36(1), point (d), and Article 62, point (d). In all other cases, for those purposes, the institution may take into account the effect of unfunded credit protection in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in accordance with Chapter 4.


**4.** Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 5, institutions may regard loans to natural persons as exposures secured by a mortgage on residential property, instead of being treated as guaranteed exposures, for the purposes of Title II, Chapters 2, 3 and 4, as applicable, where in a Member State the following conditions for those loans have been fulfilled:
- (a)the majority of loans to natural persons for the purchase of residential properties in that Member State are not provided as mortgages in legal form;
- (b)the majority of loans to natural persons for the purchase of residential properties in that Member State are guaranteed by a protection provider with a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI corresponding to credit quality step 1 or 2, that is required to repay the institution in full where the original borrower defaults;
- (c)the institution has the legal right to take a mortgage on the residential property in the event that the protection provider referred to in point (b) does not meet or becomes unable to meet its obligations under the guarantee provided.Competent authorities shall inform EBA where the conditions set out in the first subparagraph, points (a), (b) and (c), of this paragraph are met in the national territories of their jurisdictions, and shall provide the names of protection providers eligible for that treatment that fulfil the conditions of this paragraph and paragraph 5.EBA shall publish the list of all such eligible protection providers on its website and update that list yearly.


**5.** For the purposes of paragraph 4, loans referred to in that paragraph may be treated as exposures secured by a mortgage on residential property, instead of being treated as guaranteed exposures, where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)for an exposure that is treated under the Standardised Approach, the exposure meets all of the requirements to be assigned to the Standardised Approach "exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property" exposure class pursuant to Articles 124 and 125 with the exception that the institution granting the loan does not hold a mortgage over the residential property;
- (b)for an exposure that is treated under the IRB Approach, the exposure meets all of the requirements to be assigned to the IRB exposure class "retail exposures secured by residential property" referred to in Article 147(2), point (d)(ii), with the exception that the institution granting the loan does not hold a mortgage over the residential property;
- (c)there is no mortgage lien on the residential property when the loan is granted and for the loans granted from 1 January 2014 the borrower is contractually committed not to grant any mortgage lien without the consent of the institution that originally granted the loan;
- (d)the protection provider is an eligible protection provider as referred to in Article 201, and has a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI corresponding to credit quality step 1 or 2;
- (e)the protection provider is an institution or a financial sector entity subject to own funds requirements comparable to those applicable to institutions or insurance undertakings;
- (f)the protection provider has established a fully-funded mutual guarantee fund or equivalent protection for insurance undertakings to absorb credit risk losses, the calibration of which is periodically reviewed by its competent authority and is subject to periodic stress testing, at least every two years;
- (g)the institution is contractually and legally empowered to take a mortgage on the residential property in the event that the protection provider does not meet or becomes unable to meet its obligations under the guarantee provided.


**6.** Institutions that use the option provided for in paragraph 4 for a given eligible protection provider under the mechanism referred to in that paragraph shall do so for all its exposures to natural persons guaranteed by that protection provider under that mechanism.

**Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts**

*Article 113*


**1.** To calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, risk weights shall be applied to all exposures, unless those exposures are deducted from own funds or are subject to the treatment set out in Article 72e(5), first subparagraph, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Regulation. The application of risk weights shall be based on the exposure class to which the exposure is assigned and, to the extent specified in Section 2, its credit quality. Credit quality may be determined by reference to the credit assessments of ECAIs or the credit assessments of export credit agencies in accordance with Section 3. With the exception of exposures assigned to the exposure classes set out in Article 112, points (a), (b), (c) and (e), of this Regulation where the assessment in accordance with Article 79, point (b), of Directive 2013/36/EU reflects higher risk characteristics than those implied by the credit quality step to which the exposure would be assigned based on the applicable credit assessment of the nominated ECAI or export credit agency, the institution shall assign a risk weight at least one credit quality step higher than the risk weight implied by the credit assessment of the nominated ECAI or export credit agency.


**2.** For the purposes of applying a risk weight, as referred to in paragraph 1, the exposure value shall be multiplied by the risk weight specified or determined in accordance with Section 2.


**3.** Where an exposure is subject to credit protection, the exposure value or the risk weight applicable to that exposure, as appropriate, may be amended in accordance with this Chapter and Chapter 4.


**4.** Risk-weighted exposure amounts for securitised exposures shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 5.


**5.** The exposure value of any item for which no risk weight is provided for under this Chapter shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.


**6.** With the exception of exposures giving rise to Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 items, an institution may, subject to the prior approval of the competent authorities, decide not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article to the exposures of that institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary, a subsidiary of its parent undertaking, or an undertaking linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU. Competent authorities are empowered to grant approval if the following conditions are fulfilled:
- (a)the counterparty is an institution or a financial institution subject to appropriate prudential requirements;
- (b)the counterparty is included in the same consolidation as the institution on a full basis;
- (c)the counterparty is subject to the same risk evaluation, measurement and control procedures as the institution;
- (d)the counterparty is established in the same Member State as the institution;
- (e)there is no current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities from the counterparty to the institution.Where the institution, in accordance with this paragraph, is authorised not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1, it may assign a risk weight of 0 %.


**7.** With the exception of exposures giving rise to Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 items, institutions may, subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, not apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article to exposures to counterparties with which the institution has entered into an institutional protection scheme that is a contractual or statutory liability arrangement which protects those institutions and in particular ensures their liquidity and solvency to avoid bankruptcy where necessary. Competent authorities are empowered to grant permission if the following conditions are fulfilled:
- (a)the requirements set out in points (a), (d) and (e) of paragraph 6 are met;
- (b)the arrangements ensure that the institutional protection scheme is able to grant support necessary under its commitment from funds readily available to it;
- (c)the institutional protection scheme disposes of suitable and uniformly stipulated systems for the monitoring and classification of risk, which gives a complete overview of the risk situations of all the individual members and the institutional protection scheme as a whole, with corresponding possibilities to take influence; those systems shall suitably monitor defaulted exposures in accordance with Article 178(1);
- (d)the institutional protection scheme conducts its own risk review which is communicated to the individual members;
- (e)the institutional protection scheme draws up and publishes on an annual basis, a consolidated report comprising the balance sheet, the profit-and-loss account, the situation report and the risk report, concerning the institutional protection scheme as a whole, or a report comprising the aggregated balance sheet, the aggregated profit-and-loss account, the situation report and the risk report, concerning the institutional protection scheme as a whole;
- (f)members of the institutional protection scheme are obliged to give advance notice of at least 24 months if they wish to end the institutional protection scheme;
- (g)the multiple use of elements eligible for the calculation of own funds (hereinafter referred to as "multiple gearing") as well as any inappropriate creation of own funds between the members of the institutional protection scheme shall be eliminated;
- (h)the institutional protection scheme shall be based on a broad membership of credit institutions of a predominantly homogeneous business profile;
- (i)the adequacy of the systems referred to in points (c) and (d) is approved and monitored at regular intervals by the relevant competent authorities.Where the institution, in accordance with this paragraph, decides not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1, it may assign a risk weight of 0 %.

- (a)the exposure is denominated in a currency which is different from the currency of the obligor’s source of income;
- (b)the obligor does not have a hedge for its payment risk due to the currency mismatch, either by a financial instrument or foreign currency income that matches the currency of the exposure, or the total of such hedges available to the borrower covers less than 90 % of each instalment for this exposure.Where an institution is unable to single out those exposures with a currency mismatch, the risk weight multiplier of 1,5 shall apply to all unhedged exposures where the currency of the exposures is different from the domestic currency of the country of residence of the obligor.


**2.** For the purposes of this Article, source of income refers to any source that generates cash flows to the obligor, including from remittances, rental incomes or salaries, whilst excluding proceeds from selling assets or similar recourse actions by the institution.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where the pair of currencies referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), is composed of the euro and the currency of a Member State participating in the second stage of economic and monetary union (ERM II), the risk weight multiplier of 1,5 shall not apply.


# Article 124

**Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property**

*Article 124*


**1.** A non-ADC exposure that does not meet all of the conditions set out in paragraph 3, or any part of a non-ADC exposure that exceeds the nominal amount of the lien on the property, shall be treated as follows:
- (a)a non-IPRE exposure shall be risk weighted as an exposure to the counterparty that is not secured by the immovable property concerned;
- (b)an IPRE exposure shall be assigned a risk weight of 150 %.


**2.** A non-ADC exposure, up to the nominal amount of the lien on the property, where all of the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article are met, shall be treated as follows:
- (a)where the exposure is secured by a residential property,(i)a non-IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 125(1):(ii)an IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 125(1) where it meets any of the following conditions:(1)the immovable property securing the exposure is the obligor’s primary residence, either where the immovable property as a whole constitutes a single housing unit or where the immovable property securing the exposure is a housing unit that is a separated part within the immovable property;(2)the exposure is to a natural person and is secured by an income-producing residential housing unit, either where the immovable property as a whole constitutes a single housing unit or where the housing unit is a separated part within the immovable property, and total exposures of the institution to that natural person are not secured by more than four immovable properties, including those which are not residential properties or which do not meet any of the criteria set out in this point, or separate housing units within immovable properties;(3)the exposure is to associations or cooperatives of natural persons that are regulated by national law and exist with the sole purpose of granting their members the use of a primary residence in the property securing the loan;(4)the exposure is to public housing companies or not-for-profit associations that are regulated by law and exist to serve social purposes and to offer tenants long-term housing;(iii)an IPRE exposure which does not meet any of the conditions set out in point (ii) of this point, shall be treated in accordance with Article 125(2);
- (b)where the exposure is secured by commercial immovable property, it shall be treated as follows:(i)a non-IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 126(1);(ii)an IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 126(2).


**3.** In order to be eligible for the treatment referred to in paragraph 2, an exposure secured by an immovable property shall fulfil all of the following conditions:
- (a)the immovable property securing the exposure meets any of the following conditions:(i)the immovable property has been fully completed;(ii)the immovable property is forest or agricultural land;(iii)the lending is to a natural person and the immovable property is either a residential property under construction or it is land upon which a residential property is planned to be constructed where that plan has been legally approved by all relevant authorities, as applicable, and where any of the following conditions is met:(1)the immovable property does not have more than four residential housing units and will be the primary residence of the obligor and the lending to the natural person is not indirectly financing ADC exposures;(2)a central government, regional government or local authority or a public sector entity is involved, exposures to which are treated in accordance with Article 115(2) or Article 116(4), respectively, and has the legal powers and ability to ensure that the property under construction will be finished within a reasonable time frame and is required, or has committed in a legally binding manner, to ensure completion where the construction would otherwise not be finished within such reasonable time frame; alternatively, there is an equivalent legal mechanism in place to ensure that the property under construction is completed within a reasonable timeframe;
- (b)the exposure is secured by a first lien held by the institution on the immovable property, or the institution holds the first lien and any sequentially lower ranking lien on that property;
- (c)the property value is not materially dependent upon the credit quality of the obligor;
- (d)all information required at origination of the exposure and for monitoring purposes is properly documented, including information on the ability of the obligor to repay and on the valuation of the property;
- (e)the requirements set out in Article 208 are met and the valuation rules set out in Article 229(1) are complied with.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the property value and the performance of the obligor.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), institutions shall put in place underwriting policies with respect to the origination of exposures secured by immovable property that include the assessment of the ability of the borrower to repay. The underwriting policies shall include the relevant metrics for that assessment and their respective maximum levels.


**4.** By way of derogation from paragraph 3, point (b), in jurisdictions where junior liens provide the holder with a claim on collateral that is legally enforceable and constitutes an effective credit risk mitigant, junior liens held by an institution other than the one holding the senior lien may also be recognised, including where the institution does not hold the senior lien or does not hold a lien ranking between a more senior lien and a more junior lien both held by the institution.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the rules governing the liens shall ensure all of the following:
- (a)each institution holding a lien on a property can initiate the sale of the property independently from other entities holding a lien on the property;
- (b)where the sale of the property is not carried out by means of a public auction, entities holding a senior lien take reasonable steps to obtain a fair market value or the best price that may be obtained in the circumstances when exercising any power of sale on their own.


**5.** For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for undrawn facilities, liens that satisfy all eligibility requirements set out in paragraph 3 and, where applicable, paragraph 4, may be recognised where drawing under the facility is conditional on the prior or simultaneous filing of a lien to the extent of the institution’s interest in the lien once the facility is drawn, such that the institution does not have any interest in the lien to the extent that the facility is not drawn.


**6.** For the purposes of Article 125(2) and Article 126(2), the exposure-to-value ("ETV") ratio shall be calculated by dividing the gross exposure amount by the property value subject to the following conditions:
- (a)the gross exposure amount shall be calculated as the accounting value of the asset item related to the exposure secured by immovable property and any undrawn but committed amount that, once drawn, would increase the exposure value of the exposure which is secured by immovable property; that gross exposure amount shall be calculated without taking into account:(i)specific credit risk adjustments in accordance with Article 110;(ii)additional value adjustments in accordance with Article 34 related to the non-trading book business of the institution;(iii)amounts deducted in accordance with Article 36(1), point (m); and(iv)other own funds reductions related to the asset item;
- (b)the gross exposure amount shall be calculated without taking into account any type of funded or unfunded credit protection, except for pledged deposits accounts with the lending institution that meet all requirements for on-balance-sheet netting, either under master netting agreements in accordance with Articles 196 and 206 or under other on-balance-sheet netting agreements in accordance with Articles 195 and 205 and have been unconditionally and irrevocably pledged for the sole purpose of fulfilling the credit obligation related to the exposure secured by immovable property;
- (c)for exposures that are required to be treated in accordance with Article 125(2) or Article 126(2) where a party other than the institution holds a senior lien and a junior lien held by the institution is recognised under paragraph 4 of this Article, the gross exposure amount shall be calculated as the sum of the gross exposure amount of the lien held by the institution and of the gross exposure amounts for all other liens of equal or higher ranking seniority than the lien held by the institution.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), where an institution has more than one exposure secured by the same immovable property and those exposures are secured by liens on that immovable property that are sequential in ranking order without any lien held by a third party ranking in-between, the exposures shall be treated as a single combined exposure and the gross exposure amounts for the individual exposures shall be summed up to calculate the gross exposure amount for the single combined exposure.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), where there is insufficient information to be able to ascertain the ranking of the other liens, the institution shall treat those liens as ranking 
*pari passu* with the junior lien held by the institution. The institution shall first determine the risk weight in accordance with Article 125(2) or Article 126(2) (the "base risk weight"), as applicable. It shall then adjust this risk weight by a multiplier of 1,25, for the purposes of calculating the risk-weighted amounts of junior liens. Where the base risk weight corresponds to the lowest exposure-to-value bucket, the multiplier shall not be applied. The risk weight resulting from multiplying the base risk weight by 1,25 shall be capped at the risk weight that would be applied to the exposure if the requirements in paragraph 3 were not met.


**7.** Exposures to a tenant under an immovable property leasing transaction under which the institution is the lessor and the tenant has an option to purchase shall qualify as exposures secured by immovable property and shall be treated in accordance with the treatment set out in Article 125 or 126 if the applicable conditions set out in this Article are met, provided that the exposure of the institution is secured by its ownership of the property.


**8.** Member States shall designate an authority to be responsible for the application of paragraph 9. That authority shall be the competent authority or the designated authority.Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is the competent authority, it shall ensure that the relevant national bodies and authorities which have a macroprudential mandate are duly informed of the competent authority’s intention to make use of this Article, and are appropriately involved in the assessment of financial stability concerns in its Member State in accordance with paragraph 9.Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is different from the competent authority, the Member State shall adopt the necessary provisions to ensure proper coordination and exchange of information between the competent authority and the designated authority for the proper application of this Article. In particular, authorities shall be required to cooperate closely and to share all information that might be necessary for the adequate performance of the duties imposed upon the designated authority pursuant to this Article. That cooperation shall aim to avoid any form of duplicative or inconsistent action between the competent authority and the designated authority, as well as to ensure that the interaction with other measures, in particular measures taken under Article 458 of this Regulation and Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU, is duly taken into account.


**9.** Based on the data collected under Article 430a and on any other relevant indicators, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article shall periodically, and at least annually, assess whether the risk weights laid down in Articles 125 and 126 for exposures secured by immovable property located in the territory of the Member State of that authority are appropriately based on:
- (a)the loss experience of exposures secured by immovable property;
- (b)forward-looking immovable property market developments.Where, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article concludes that the risk weights set out in Article 125 or 126 do not adequately reflect the actual risks related to exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on residential property or on commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority, and if it considers that the inadequacy of the risk weights could adversely affect current or future financial stability in its Member State, it may increase the risk weights applicable to those exposures within the ranges determined in the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph or impose stricter criteria than those set out in paragraph 3 of this Article.The authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article shall notify EBA and the ESRB of any adjustments to risk weights and criteria applied pursuant to this paragraph. Within one month of receipt of that notification, EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned and may indicate in that opinion, where necessary, whether they consider that the adjustments to risk weights and criteria are also recommended for other Member States. EBA and the ESRB shall publish the risk weights and criteria for exposures referred to in Articles 125 and 126 and Article 199(1), point (a), as implemented by the relevant authority.For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article may increase the risk weights laid down in Article 125(1), first subparagraph, Article 125(2), first subparagraph, Article 126(1), first subparagraph, or Article 126(2), first subparagraph, or impose stricter criteria than those set out in paragraph 3 of this Article for exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority. That authority shall not increase those risk weights to more than 150 %.For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article may also reduce the percentages of the property value referred to in Article 125(1) or Article 126(1) or the exposure-to-value percentages that define the exposure-to-value risk weight bucket set out in in Article 125(2), Table 1, or in Article 126(2), Table 1. The relevant authority shall ensure consistency across all exposure-to-value risk weight buckets, such that the risk weight of a lower exposure-to-value risk weight bucket is always lower or equal to the risk weight of an upper exposure-to-value risk weight bucket.


**10.** Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 sets higher risk weights or stricter criteria pursuant to paragraph 9, institutions shall have a six-month transitional period to apply them.


**11.** EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the types of factors to be considered for the assessment of the appropriateness of the risk weights referred to in paragraph 9.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 January 2026.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**12.** The ESRB may, by means of recommendations, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, and in close cooperation with EBA, give guidance to authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article on both of the following:
- (a)factors which could "adversely affect current or future financial stability" referred to in paragraph 9, second subparagraph;
- (b)indicative benchmarks that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 is to take into account when determining higher risk weights.


**13.** Institutions established in a Member State shall apply the risk weights and criteria that have been determined by the authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 9 to their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that other Member State.


**14.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what constitutes an "equivalent legal mechanism in place to ensure that the property under construction is completed within a reasonable timeframe", in accordance with paragraph 3, point (a)(iii)(2).EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 125

**Exposures secured by mortgages on residential property**

*Article 125*


**1.** For an exposure secured by residential property as referred to in Article 124(2), point (a)(i) or (ii), the part of the exposure up to 55 % of the property value shall be assigned a risk weight of 20 %.Where an institution holds a junior lien and there are more senior liens not held by that institution, to determine the part of the institution’s exposure that is eligible for the 20 % risk weight, the amount of 55 % of the property value shall be reduced by the amount of the more senior liens not held by the institution.Where liens not held by the institution rank 
*pari passu* with the lien held by the institution, to determine the part of the institution’s exposure that is eligible for the 20 % risk weight, the amount of 55 % of the property value, reduced by the amount of any more senior liens not held by the institution, shall be reduced by the product of:
- (a)55 % of the property value, reduced by the amount of more senior liens, if any, both held by the institution and held by other institutions; and
- (b)the amount of liens not held by the institution that rank 
*pari passu* with the lien held by the institution divided by the sum of all 
*pari passu* liens.Where, in accordance with Article 124(9), the competent authority or designated authority has set a higher risk weight or a lower percentage of the property value than those referred to in this paragraph, institutions shall use the risk weight or percentage set in accordance with Article 124(9).The remaining part of the exposure referred to in the first subparagraph, if any, shall be risk weighted as an exposure to the counterparty that is not secured by residential property.


**2.** An exposure as referred to in Article 124(2), point (a)(iii), shall be assigned the risk weight set in accordance with the respective exposure-to-value risk weight bucket in Table 1.For the purposes of this paragraph, where, in accordance with Article 124(9), the competent authority or designated authority, has set a higher risk weight or a lower exposure-to-value percentage than those referred to in this paragraph, institutions shall use the risk weight or percentage set in accordance with Article 124(9).

# Article 126

**Exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property**

*Article 126*


**1.** For an exposure secured by commercial immovable property as referred to in Article 124(2), point (b)(i), the part of the exposure up to 55 % of the property value shall be assigned a risk weight of 60 %.Where an institution holds a junior lien and there are more senior liens not held by that institution, to determine the part of the institution’s exposure that is eligible for the 60 % risk weight, the amount of 55 % of the property value shall be reduced by the amount of the more senior liens not held by the institution.Where liens not held by the institution rank 
*pari passu* with the lien held by the institution, to determine the part of the institution’s exposure that is eligible for the 60 % risk weight, the amount of 55 % of the property value, reduced by the amount of any more senior liens not held by the institution, shall be reduced by the product of:
- (a)55 % of the property value, reduced by the amount of more senior liens, if any, both held by the institution and held by other institutions; and
- (b)the amount of liens not held by the institution that rank 
*pari passu* with the lien held by the institution divided by the sum of all 
*pari passu* liens.Where, in accordance with Article 124(9), the competent authority or designated authority, has set a higher risk weight or a lower percentage of the property value than those referred to in this paragraph, institutions shall use the risk weight or percentage set in accordance with Article 124(9).The remaining part of the exposure referred to in the first subparagraph, if any, shall be risk weighted as an exposure to the counterparty that is not secured by commercial immovable property.


**2.** An exposure as referred to in Article 124(2), point (b)(ii), shall be assigned the risk weight set in accordance with the respective exposure-to-value risk weight bucket in Table 1.For the purposes of this paragraph, where, in accordance with Article 124(9), the competent authority or designated authority, has set a higher risk weight or a lower exposure-to-value percentage than those referred to in this paragraph, institutions shall use the risk weight or percentage set in accordance with Article 124(9).

| Risk weight | 70 % | 90 % | 110 % | By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions may apply the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to exposures secured by commercial immovable property which is situated within the territory of a Member State, where the competent authority of that Member State has published in accordance with Article 430a(3), loss rates for such exposures which, based on the aggregate data reported by institutions in that Member State for that national immovable property market, do not exceed any of the following limits for losses aggregated across such exposures existing in the previous year:
- (a)the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (d), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (f), does not exceed 0,3 %;
- (b)the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (e), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (f), does not exceed 0,5 %.


**3.** Institutions may apply the derogation referred to in paragraph 2, third subparagraph, of this Article also in cases where the competent authority of a third country which applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union as determined in a decision of the Commission adopted in accordance with Article 107(4), publishes corresponding loss rates for exposures secured by commercial immovable property situated within the territory of that third country.Where a competent authority of a third country does not publish corresponding loss rates for exposures secured by commercial immovable property situated within the territory of that third country, EBA may publish such information for a third country, provided that valid statistical data, that are statistically representative of the corresponding commercial immovable property market, are available.


**4.** EBA shall assess the appropriateness of adjusting the treatment of exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property, including IPRE and non-IPRE exposures, taking into account the appropriateness of risk weights and the relative differences in risk of exposures secured by residential property, the differences in risk sensitivity of IPRE exposures secured by residential property referred to in in Article 125(2), Table 1, and IPRE exposures secured by commercial immovable property referred to in Table 1 in this Article and the recommendations of the ESRB on the vulnerabilities in the commercial immovable property sector in the Union. EBA shall submit a report on its findings to the Commission by 31 December 2027.On the basis of the report referred to in the first subparagraph and taking due account of the related internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal by 31 December 2028.


# Article 126a

**Land acquisition, development and construction exposures**

*Article 126A*


**1.** An ADC exposure shall be assigned a risk weight of 150 %.


**2.** ADC exposures to residential property may be assigned a risk weight of 100 %, provided that the institution applies sound origination and monitoring standards which meet the requirements laid down in Articles 74 and 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU and where at least one of the following conditions is met:
- (a)legally binding pre-sale or pre-lease contracts for which the purchaser or tenant has made a substantial cash deposit which is subject to forfeiture if the contract is terminated or where the financing is ensured in an equivalent manner, or legally binding sale or lease contracts, including where the payment is made by instalments as the construction works progress, amount to a significant portion of total contracts;
- (b)the obligor has substantial equity at risk, which is represented as an appropriate amount of obligor-contributed equity to the residential property value upon completion.


**3.** By 10 July 2025, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, specifying the terms "substantial cash deposits", "financing ensured in an equivalent manner", "significant portion of total contracts" and "appropriate amount of obligor-contributed equity", taking into account the specificities of institutions’ lending to public housing or not-for-profit entities across the Union that are regulated by law and that exist to serve social purposes and to offer tenants long-term housing.


# Article 127

**Exposures in default**

*Article 127*


**1.** The unsecured part of any item where the obligor has defaulted in accordance with Article 178, or in the case of retail exposures, the unsecured part of any credit facility which has defaulted in accordance with Article 178 shall be assigned a risk weight of:
- (a)150 %, where the sum of specific credit risk adjustments and of the amounts deducted in accordance with point (m) Article 36(1) is less than 20 % of the unsecured part of the exposure value if those specific credit risk adjustments and deductions were not applied;
- (b)100 %, where the sum of the specific credit risk adjustments and of the amounts deducted in accordance with point (m) Article 36(1) is no less than 20 % of the unsecured part of the exposure value if those specific credit risk adjustments and deductions were not applied.For the purpose of calculating the specific credit risk adjustments referred to in the first subparagraph for an exposure that is purchased when already in default, institutions shall include in the calculation any positive difference between the amount owed by the obligor on that exposure and the sum of the additional own funds reduction if that exposure were fully written off and any already existing own funds reductions related to that exposure.


**2.** For the purpose of determining the secured part of a defaulted exposure, collateral and guarantees shall be eligible for credit risk mitigation purposes in accordance with Chapter 4.


**3.** The exposure value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments of non-IPRE exposures secured by residential property or commercial immovable property in accordance with Articles 125 and 126, respectively, shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 % if a default has occurred in accordance with Article 178.


**4.** The exposure value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments of exposures fully and completely secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property in accordance with Article 126 shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 % if a default has occurred in accordance with Article 178.


# Article 128

**Subordinated debt exposures**

*Article 128*


**1.** The following exposures shall be treated as subordinated debt exposures:
- (a)debt exposures which are subordinated to claims of ordinary unsecured creditors;

# Article 129

**Exposures in the form of covered bonds**

*Article 129*


**1.** To be eligible for the preferential treatment set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article, covered bonds as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 3, 3a and 3b of this Article and shall be collateralised by any of the following eligible assets:
- (a)exposures to or guaranteed by central governments, the ESCB central banks, public sector entities, regional governments or local authorities in the Union;
- (b)exposures to or guaranteed by third country central governments, third-country central banks, multilateral development banks, international organisations that qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter, and exposures to or guaranteed by third-country public sector entities, third-country regional governments or third-country local authorities that are risk weighted as exposures to institutions or central governments and central banks in accordance with Article 115(1) or (2), or Article 116(1), (2) or (4) respectively and that qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter, and exposures within the meaning of this point that qualify as a minimum for the credit quality step 2 as set out in this Chapter, provided that they do not exceed 20 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institutions;
- (c)exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 1 or credit quality step 2, or exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 3 where those exposures are in the form of:(i)short‐term deposits with an original maturity not exceeding 100 days, where used to meet the cover pool liquidity buffer requirement of Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162; or(ii)derivative contracts that meet the requirements of Article 11(1) of that Directive, where permitted by the competent authorities;
- (d)loans secured by residential property up to the lesser of the principal amount of the liens that are combined with any prior liens and 80 % of the value of the pledged properties;
- (e)residential loans fully guaranteed by an eligible protection provider referred to in Article 201 qualifying for the credit quality step 2 or above as set out in this Chapter, where the portion of each of the loans that is used to meet the requirement set out in this paragraph for collateralisation of the covered bond does not represent more than 80 % of the value of the corresponding residential property located in France, and where a loan-to-income ratio respects at most 33 % when the loan has been granted. There shall be no mortgage liens on the residential property when the loan is granted, and for the loans granted from 1 January 2014 the borrower shall be contractually committed not to grant such liens without the consent of the credit institution that granted the loan. The loan-to-income ratio represents the share of the gross income of the borrower that covers the reimbursement of the loan, including the interests. The protection provider shall be either a financial institution authorised and supervised by the competent authorities and subject to prudential requirements comparable to those applied to institutions in terms of robustness or an institution or an insurance undertaking. It shall establish a mutual guarantee fund or equivalent protection for insurance undertakings to absorb credit risk losses, whose calibration shall be periodically reviewed by the competent authorities. Both the credit institution and the protection provider shall carry out a creditworthiness assessment of the borrower;
- (f)loans secured by commercial immovable property up to the lesser of the principal amount of the liens that are combined with any prior liens and 60 % of the value of the pledged properties. Loans secured by commercial immovable property are eligible where the loan‐to‐value ratio of 60 % is exceeded up to a maximum level of 70 % if the value of the total assets pledged as collateral for the covered bonds exceed the nominal amount outstanding on the covered bond by at least 10 %, and the bondholders’ claim meets the legal certainty requirements set out in Chapter 4. The bondholders’ claim shall take priority over all other claims on the collateral;
- (g)loans secured by maritime liens on ships up to the difference between 60 % of the value of the pledged ship and the value of any prior maritime liens.For the purposes of paragraph 1a, exposures caused by the transmission and management of the payments of the obligors of loans secured by pledged properties of debt securities or by the transmission and management of liquidation proceeds in respect of such loans shall not be comprised in calculating the limits referred to in that paragraph.The competent authorities may, after consulting EBA, partly waive the application of point (c) of the first subparagraph and allow credit quality step 2 for up to 10 % of the total exposure of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institution, provided that significant potential concentration problems in the Member States concerned can be documented due to the application of the credit quality step 1 requirement referred to in that point.Without prejudice to the first subparagraph, point (c), of this paragraph, until 1 July 2027, indirect exposures to credit institutions without an external rating that guarantee mortgage loans until their registration shall be treated for the purposes of that point as exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 1, provided that they are short-term exposures assigned to grade A under Article 121 and that the guaranteed mortgage loans will, once registered, be eligible for the preferential treatment pursuant to the first subparagraph, points (d), (e) and (f), of this paragraph.


**1a.** For the purposes of point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the following shall apply:(a)for exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 1, the exposure shall not exceed 15 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing credit institution;(b)for exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 2, the exposure shall not exceed 10 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing credit institution;(c)for exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 3 that take the form of short‐term deposits, as referred to in point (c)(i) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, or the form of derivative contracts, as referred to in point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, the total exposure shall not exceed 8 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing credit institution; the competent authorities designated pursuant to Article 18(2) of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 may, after consulting EBA, allow exposures to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 3 in the form of derivative contracts, provided that significant potential concentration problems in the Member States concerned due to the application of credit quality step 1 and 2 requirements referred to in this paragraph can be documented;(d)the total exposure to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 1, 2 or 3 shall not exceed 15 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing credit institution and the total exposure to credit institutions that qualify for credit quality step 2 or 3 shall not exceed 10 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing credit institution.


**1b.** Paragraph 1a of this Article shall not apply to the use of covered bonds as eligible collateral as permitted pursuant to Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162.


**1c.** For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the limit of 80 % shall apply on a loan‐by‐loan basis, shall determine the portion of the loan contributing to the coverage of liabilities attached to the covered bond, and shall apply throughout the entire maturity of the loan.


**1d.** For the purposes of points (f) and (g) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the limits of 60 % or 70 % shall apply on a loan‐by‐loan basis, shall determine the portion of the loan contributing to the coverage of liabilities attached to the covered bond, and shall apply throughout the entire maturity of the loan.


**2.** The situations referred to in points (a) to (f) of paragraph 1 shall also include collateral that is exclusively restricted by legislation to the protection of the bond-holders against losses.


**3.** For immovable property and ships collateralising covered bonds that comply with this Regulation, the requirements set out in Article 208 shall be met. The monitoring of property values in accordance with point (a) of Article 208(3) shall be carried out frequently and at least annually for all immovable property and ships.For the purpose of valuing immovable property, the competent authorities designated pursuant to Article 18(2) of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 may allow that property to be valued at or at less than the market value, or in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, at the mortgage lending value of that property, without applying the limits set out in Article 229(1), point (e), of this Regulation.


**3a.** In addition to being collateralised by the eligible assets listed in paragraph 1 of this Article, covered bonds shall be subject to a minimum level of 5 % of overcollateralisation as defined in point (14) of Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162.For the purposes of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the total nominal amount of all cover assets as defined in point (4) of Article 3 of that Directive shall be at least of the same value as the total nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds ("nominal principle"), and shall consist of eligible assets as set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.Member States may set a lower minimum level of overcollateralisation for covered bonds or authorise their competent authorities to set such a level, provided that:(a)either the calculation of overcollateralisation is based on a formal approach where the underlying risk of the assets is taken into account, or the valuation of the assets is subject to the mortgage lending value; and(b)the minimum level of overcollateralisation is not lower than 2 %, based on the nominal principle referred to in Article 15(6) and (7) of Directive (EU) 2019/2162.The assets contributing to a minimum level of overcollateralisation shall not be subject to the limits on exposure size set out in paragraph 1a and shall not count towards those limits.


**3b.** Eligible assets listed in paragraph 1 of this Article may be included in the cover pool as substitution assets as defined in point (13) of Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162, subject to the limits on credit quality and exposure size set out in paragraphs 1 and 1a of this Article.


**4.** Covered bonds for which a directly applicable credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is available shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with Table 1 which corresponds to the credit assessment of the ECAI in accordance with Article 136.

**Own funds requirements for exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs**

*Article 132*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU's exposures, calculated in accordance with the approaches referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, with the percentage of units or shares held by those institutions.


**2.** Where the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article are met, institutions may apply the look-through approach in accordance with Article 132a(1) or the mandate-based approach in accordance with Article 132a(2).Subject to Article 132b(2), institutions that do not apply the look-through approach or the mandate-based approach shall assign a risk weight of 1 250 % ("fall-back approach") to their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU.Institutions may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by using a combination of the approaches referred to in this paragraph, provided that the conditions for using those approaches are met.


**3.** Institutions may determine the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the CIU is one of the following:(i)an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), governed by Directive 2009/65/EC;(ii)an AIF managed by an EU AIFM registered under Article 3(3) of Directive 2011/61/EU;(iii)an AIF managed by an EU AIFM authorised under Article 6 of Directive 2011/61/EU;(iv)an AIF managed by a non-EU AIFM authorised under Article 37 of Directive 2011/61/EU;(v)a non-EU AIF managed by a non-EU AIFM and marketed in accordance with Article 42 of Directive 2011/61/EU;(vi)a non-EU AIF not marketed in the Union and managed by a non-EU AIFM established in a third country that is covered by a delegated act referred to in Article 67(6) of Directive 2011/61/EU;
- (b)the CIU's prospectus or equivalent document includes the following:(i)the categories of assets in which the CIU is authorised to invest;(ii)where investment limits apply, the relative limits and the methodologies to calculate them;
- (c)reporting by the CIU or the CIU management company to the institution complies with the following requirements:(i)the exposures of the CIU are reported at least as frequently as those of the institution;(ii)the granularity of the financial information is sufficient to allow the institution to calculate the CIU's risk -weighted exposure amount in accordance with the approach chosen by the institution;(iii)where the institution applies the look-through approach, information about the underlying exposures is verified by an independent third party.By way of derogation from point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, multilateral and bilateral development banks and other institutions that co-invest in a CIU with multilateral or bilateral development banks may determine the risk-weighted exposure amount of that CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a, provided that the conditions set out in points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph are met and that the CIU's investment mandate limits the types of assets that the CIU can invest in to assets that promote sustainable development in developing countries.Institutions shall notify their competent authority of the CIUs to which they apply the treatment referred to in the second subparagraph.By way of derogation from point (c)(i) of the first subparagraph, where the institution determines the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the mandate-based approach, the reporting by the CIU or the CIU management company to the institution may be limited to the investment mandate of the CIU and any changes thereof and may be done only when the institution incurs the exposure to the CIU for the first time and when there is a change in the investment mandate of the CIU.


**4.** Institutions that do not have adequate data or information to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a may rely on the calculations of a third party, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the third party is one of the following:(i)the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;(ii)for CIUs not covered by point (i) of this point, the CIU management company, provided that the company meets the condition set out in point (a) of paragraph 3;
- (b)the third party carries out the calculation in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a(1), (2) or (3), as applicable;
- (c)an external auditor has confirmed the correctness of the third party's calculation.Institutions that rely on third-party calculations shall multiply the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures resulting from those calculations by a factor of 1,2.By way of derogation from the second subparagraph, where the institution has unrestricted access to the detailed calculations carried out by the third party, the factor of 1,2 shall not apply. The institution shall provide those calculations to its competent authority upon request.


**5.** Where an institution applies the approaches referred to in Article 132a for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures ("level 1 CIU"), and any of the underlying exposures of the level 1 CIU is an exposure in the form of units or shares in another CIU ("level 2 CIU"), the risk-weighted exposure amount of the level 2 CIU's exposures may be calculated by using any of the three approaches described in paragraph 2 of this Article. The institution may use the look-through approach to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs' exposures in level 3 and any subsequent level only where it used that approach for the calculation in the preceding level. In any other scenario it shall use the fall-back approach.


**6.** The risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures calculated in accordance with the look-through approach and the mandate-based approach set out in Article 132a(1) and (2) shall be capped at the risk-weighted amount of that CIU's exposures calculated in accordance with the fall-back approach.


**7.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions that apply the look-through approach in accordance with Article 132a(1) may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures, calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the risk weight (
$$RW
^{*}
_{i}$$
) calculated in accordance with the formula set out in Article 132c, provided that the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institutions measure the value of their holdings of units or shares in a CIU at historical cost but measure the value of the underlying assets of the CIU at fair value if they apply the look-through approach;
- (b)a change in the market value of the units or shares for which institutions measure the value at historical cost changes neither the amount of own funds of those institutions nor the exposure value associated with those holdings.


# Article 132a

**Approaches for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs**

*Article 132A*


**1.** Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU shall look through to those exposures to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, risk weighting all underlying exposures of the CIU as if they were directly held by those institutions.


**2.** Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU to use the look-through approach may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of those exposures in accordance with the limits set in the CIU's mandate and relevant law.Institutions shall carry out the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph under the assumption that the CIU first incurs exposures to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law in the exposures attracting the highest own funds requirement and then continues incurring exposures in descending order until the maximum total exposure limit is reached, and that the CIU applies leverage to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law, where applicable.Institutions shall carry out the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter, in Chapter 5, and in Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title.


**3.** By way of derogation from Article 92(4), point (e), institutions that calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU’s exposures in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article may calculate the own funds requirement for the credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative exposures of that CIU as an amount equal to 50 % of the own funds requirement for those derivative exposures calculated in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 3, 4 or 5, of this Title, as applicable.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivative exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were incurred directly by the institution.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount referred to in paragraph 2 where one or more of the inputs required for that calculation are not available.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 132b

**Exclusions from the approaches for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs**

*Article 132B*


**1.** Institutions may exclude from the calculations referred to in Article 132 Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 instruments and eligible liabilities instruments held by a CIU which institutions shall deduct in accordance with Article 36(1) and Articles 56, 66 and 72e respectively.


**2.** Institutions may exclude from the calculations referred to in Article 132 equity exposures underlying exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs to entities whose credit obligations are assigned a 0 % risk weight under this Chapter, including those publicly sponsored entities where a 0 % risk weight can be applied, and equity exposures referred to in Article 133(5), and instead apply the treatment set out in Article 133 to those equity exposures.


# Article 132c

**Treatment of off-balance-sheet exposures to CIUs**

*Article 132C*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their off-balance-sheet items with the potential to be converted into exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the following risk weight:
- (a)for all exposures for which institutions use one of the approaches set out in Article 132a:
$$RW
^{*}
_{i} = 
\frac{RWAE
_{i}}{E
^{*}
_{i}} \times 
\frac{A
_{i}}{EQ
_{i}}$$
where:
- **
$$RW
^{*}
_{i}$$
**=the risk weight;
- **i**=the index denoting the CIU:
- **RWAEi**=the amount calculated in accordance with Article 132a for a CIUi;
- **
$$E
^{*}
_{i}$$
**=the exposure value of the exposures of CIUi;
- **Ai**=the accounting value of assets of CIUi; and
- **EQi**=the accounting value of the equity of CIUi.
- (b)for all other exposures, 
$$RW
^{*}
_{i} = 1250 %$$
.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a minimum value commitment that meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article as the discounted present value of the guaranteed amount using a discount factor that is derived from a risk-free rate pursuant to Article 325l(2) or (3), as applicable. Institutions may reduce the exposure value of the minimum value commitment by any losses recognised with respect to the minimum value commitment under the applicable accounting standard.Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments that meet all the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article by multiplying the exposure value of those exposures by a conversion factor of 20 % and the risk weight derived under Article 132 or 152.


**3.** Institutions shall determine the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments in accordance with paragraph 2 where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the off-balance-sheet exposure of the institution is a minimum value commitment for an investment into units or shares of one or more CIUs under which the institution is only obliged to pay out under the minimum value commitment where the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs is below a predetermined threshold at one or more points in time, as specified in the contract;
- (b)the CIU is any of the following:(i)a UCITS as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC; or(ii)an AIF as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU which solely invests in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets referred to in Article 50(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, where the mandate of the AIF does not allow a leverage higher than that allowed under Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;
- (c)the current market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU underlying the minimum value commitment without considering the effect of the off-balance-sheet minimum value commitments covers or exceeds the present value of the threshold specified in the minimum value commitment;
- (d)when the excess of the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs over the present value of the minimum value commitment declines, the institution, or another undertaking in so far as it is covered by the supervision on a consolidated basis to which the institution itself is subject in accordance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2002/87/EC, can influence the composition of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs or limit the potential for a further reduction of the excess in other ways;
- (e)the ultimate direct or indirect beneficiary of the minimum value commitment is typically a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.;


# Article 133

**Equity exposures**

*Article 133*


**1.** All of the following shall be classified as equity exposures:
- (a)any exposure that meets all of the following conditions:(i)it is irredeemable in the sense that the return of invested funds can be achieved only by the sale of the investment or sale of the rights to the investment or by the liquidation of the issuer;(ii)it does not embody an obligation on the part of the issuer;(iii)it conveys a residual claim on the assets or income of the issuer;
- (b)instruments that would qualify as Tier 1 items if issued by an institution;
- (c)instruments that embody an obligation on the part of the issuer and meet any of the following conditions:(i)the issuer is able to defer the settlement of the obligation indefinitely;(ii)the obligation requires, or permits at the issuer’s discretion, settlement by issuance of a fixed number of the issuer’s equity shares;(iii)the obligation requires, or permits at the issuer’s discretion, settlement by issuance of a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares and, ceteris paribus, any change in the value of the obligation is attributable to, comparable to, and in the same direction as, the change in the value of a fixed number of the issuer’s equity shares;(iv)the holder of the instrument has the option of requiring that the obligation be settled in equity shares, unless one of the following conditions is met:(1)in the case of a traded instrument, the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the instrument is traded on the market more like the debt of the issuer than like its equity;(2)in the case of non-traded instruments, the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the instrument should be treated as a debt position;
- (d)debt obligations and other securities, partnerships, derivatives or other vehicles structured in such a way that the economic substance is similar to the exposures referred to in points (a), (b) and (c), including liabilities from which the return is linked to that of equities;
- (e)equity exposures that are recorded as a loan but arise from a debt-equity swap made as part of the orderly realisation or restructuring of the debt.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c)(iii), obligations include those that require or permit settlement by issuance of a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares, for which the change in the monetary value of the obligation is equal to the change in the fair value of a fixed number of equity shares multiplied by a specified factor, where both the factor and the referenced number of shares are fixed.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c)(iv), where one of the conditions laid down in that point is met, the institution may decompose the risks for regulatory purposes, subject to the prior permission of the competent authority.


**2.** Equity investments shall not be treated as equity exposures in any of the following cases:
- (a)the equity investments are structured in such a way that their economic substance is similar to the economic substance of debt holdings which do not meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1;
- (b)the equity investments constitute securitisation exposures.


**3.** Equity exposures, other than those referred to in paragraphs 4 to 7, shall be assigned a risk weight of 250 %, unless those exposures are required to be deducted or risk weighted in accordance with Part Two.


**4.** The following equity exposures to unlisted companies shall be assigned a risk weight of 400 %, unless those exposures are required to be deducted or risk weighted in accordance with Part Two:
- (a)investments for short-term resale purposes;
- (b)investments in venture capital firms or similar investments which are acquired in anticipation of significant short-term capital gains.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, long-term equity investments, including investments in equities of corporate clients with which the institution has or intends to establish a long-term business relationship and debt-equity swaps for corporate restructuring purposes shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5, as applicable. For the purposes of this Article, a long-term equity investment is an equity investment that is held for three years or longer or incurred with the intention to be held for three years or longer as approved by the institution’s senior management.


**5.** Institutions that have received the prior permission of the competent authorities may assign a risk weight of 100 % to equity exposures incurred under legislative programmes to stimulate specified sectors of the economy, up to the part of such equity exposures that in aggregate does not exceed 10 % of the institutions’ own funds, that comply with all of the following conditions:
- (a)the legislative programmes provide significant subsidies or guarantees, including by multilateral development banks, public development credit institutions as defined in Article 429a(2) or international organisations, for the investment to the institution;
- (b)the legislative programmes involve some form of government oversight;
- (c)the legislative programmes involve restrictions on the equity investment, such as limitations on the size and types of businesses in which the institution is investing, on allowable amounts of ownership interests, on the geographical location and on other relevant factors that limit the potential risk of the investment for the investing institution.


**6.** Equity exposures to central banks shall be assigned a risk weight of 0 %.


**7.** An equity holding that is recorded as a loan but that has arisen from a debt-equity swap made as part of the orderly realisation or restructuring of the debt shall not be assigned a risk weight lower than the risk weight that would apply if the equity holding were treated as a debt exposure.


# Article 134

**Other items**

*Article 134*


**1.** Tangible assets within the meaning of item 10 under the heading 'Assets' in Article 4 of Directive 86/635/EEC shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.


**2.** Prepayments and accrued income for which an institution is unable to determine the counterparty in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC, shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.


**3.** Cash items in the process of collection shall be assigned a 20 % risk weight. Cash owned and held by the institution, or in transit, and equivalent cash items shall be assigned a 0 % risk weight.


**4.** Gold bullion held in own vaults or on an allocated basis to the extent backed by bullion liabilities shall be assigned a 0 % risk weight.


**5.** In the case of asset sale and repurchase agreements and outright forward purchases, the risk weight shall be that assigned to the assets in question and not to the counterparties to the transactions.


**6.** Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures subject to the condition that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures, up to a maximum of 1 250 % and multiplied by the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative to obtain the risk-weighted exposure amount. The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation.


**7.** The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments are the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option the exercise of which is reasonably certain. A party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment related to the residual value of a leased property and that payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions in Article 201 regarding the eligibility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising other types of guarantees provided in Articles 213 to 215, that payment obligation may be taken into account as unfunded credit protection under Chapter 4. These exposures shall be assigned to the relevant exposure class in accordance with Article 112. When the exposure is a residual value of leased assets, the risk-weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated as follows: 1/t * 100 % * residual value, where t is the greater of 1 and the nearest number of whole years of the lease remaining.


# Article 135

**Use of credit assessments by ECAIs**

*Article 135*


**1.** An external credit assessment may be used to determine the risk weight of an exposure under this Chapter only if it has been issued by an ECAI or has been endorsed by an ECAI in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.


**2.** EBA shall publish the list of ECAIs in accordance with Article 2(4) and Article 18(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on its website.


**3.** By 10 July 2025, ESMA shall prepare a report on whether ESG risks are appropriately reflected in ECAI credit risk rating methodologies and submit that report to the Commission.On the basis of that report, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council by 10 January 2026.

**Mapping of ECAI's credit assessments**

*Article 136*


**1.** EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft implementing technical standards to specify for all ECAIs, with which of the credit quality steps set out in Section 2 the relevant credit assessments of the ECAI correspond ("mapping"). Those determinations shall be objective and consistent.EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 July 2014 and shall submit revised draft implementing technical standards where necessary.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 respectively.


**2.** When determining the mapping of credit assessments, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall comply with the following requirements:
- (a)in order to differentiate between the relative degrees of risk expressed by each credit assessment, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall consider quantitative factors such as the long-term default rate associated with all items assigned the same credit assessment. For recently established ECAIs and for those that have compiled only a short record of default data, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall ask the ECAI what it believes to be the long-term default rate associated with all items assigned the same credit assessment;
- (b)in order to differentiate between the relative degrees of risk expressed by each credit assessment, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall consider qualitative factors such as the pool of issuers that the ECAI covers, the range of credit assessments that the ECAI assigns, each credit assessment meaning and the ECAI's definition of default;
- (c)EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall compare default rates experienced for each credit assessment of a particular ECAI and compare them with a benchmark built on the basis of default rates experienced by other ECAIs on a population of issuers that present an equivalent level of credit risk;
- (d)where the default rates experienced for the credit assessment of a particular ECAI are materially and systematically higher then the benchmark, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall assign a higher credit quality step in the credit quality assessment scale to the ECAI credit assessment;
- (e)where EBA, EIOPA and ESMA have increased the associated risk weight for a specific credit assessment of a particular ECAI, and where default rates experienced for that ECAI's credit assessment are no longer materially and systematically higher than the benchmark, EBA, EIOPA and ESMA may restore the original credit quality step in the credit quality assessment scale for the ECAI credit assessment.


**3.** EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the quantitative factors referred to in point (a), the qualitative factors referred to in point (b) and the benchmark referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2.EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 July 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 respectively.


# Article 137

**Use of credit assessments by export credit agencies**

*Article 137*


**1.** For the purpose of Article 114, institutions may use credit assessments of an Export Credit Agency that the institution has nominated, if either of the following conditions is met:
- (a)it is a consensus risk score from export credit agencies participating in the OECD "Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits";
- (b)the Export Credit Agency publishes its credit assessments, and the Export Credit Agency subscribes to the OECD agreed methodology, and the credit assessment is associated with one of the eight minimum export insurance premiums that the OECD agreed methodology establishes. An institution may revoke its nomination of an Export Credit Agency. An institution shall substantiate the revocation if there are concrete indications that the intention underlying the revocation is to reduce the capital adequacy requirements.


**2.** Exposures for which a credit assessment by an Export Credit Agency is recognised for risk weighting purposes shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with Table 9.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 | Column 7 | Column 8 | Column 9 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MEIP | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 
| Risk weight | 0 % | 0 % | 20 % | 50 % | 100 % | 100 % | 100 % | 150 % |


# Article 138

**General requirements**

*Article 138*

An institution may nominate one or more ECAIs to be used for the determination of risk weights to be assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items. An institution may revoke its nomination of an ECAI. An institution shall substantiate the revocation if there are concrete indications that the intention underlying the revocation is to reduce the capital adequacy requirements. Credit assessments shall not be used selectively. An institution shall use solicited credit assessments. However it may use unsolicited credit assessments if EBA has confirmed that unsolicited credit assessments of an ECAI do not differ in quality from solicited credit assessments of this ECAI. EBA shall refuse or revoke this confirmation in particular if the ECAI has used an unsolicited credit assessment to put pressure on the rated entity to place an order for a credit assessment or other services. In using credit assessment, institutions shall comply with the following requirements:
- (a)an institution which decides to use the credit assessments produced by an ECAI for a certain class of items shall use those credit assessments consistently for all exposures belonging to that class;
- (b)an institution which decides to use the credit assessments produced by an ECAI shall use them in a continuous and consistent way over time;
- (c)an institution shall only use ECAIs credit assessments that take into account all amounts both in principal and in interest owed to it;
- (d)where only one credit assessment is available from a nominated ECAI for a rated item, that credit assessment shall be used to determine the risk weight for that item;
- (e)where two credit assessments are available from nominated ECAIs and the two correspond to different risk weights for a rated item, the higher risk weight shall be assigned;
- (f)where more than two credit assessments are available from nominated ECAIs for a rated item, the two assessments generating the two lowest risk weights shall be referred to. If the two lowest risk weights are different, the higher risk weight shall be assigned. If the two lowest risk weights are the same, that risk weight shall be assigned;
- (g)for exposures to institutions, an institution shall not use an ECAI credit assessment that incorporates assumptions of implicit government support, unless the respective ECAI credit assessment refers to an institution owned by or set up and sponsored by central governments, regional governments or local authorities.For the purposes of the first paragraph, point (g), in the case of institutions, other than institutions owned by or set up and sponsored by central governments, regional governments or local authorities, for which only ECAI credit assessments exist which incorporate assumptions of implicit government support, exposures to such institutions shall be treated as exposures to unrated institutions in accordance with Article 121."Implicit government support" means that the central government, regional government or local authority would act to prevent creditors of the institution from incurring losses in the event of the institution’s default or distress.
# Article 139

**Issuer and issue credit assessment**

*Article 139*


**1.** Where a credit assessment exists for a specific issuing programme or facility to which the item constituting the exposure belongs, this credit assessment shall be used to determine the risk weight to be assigned to that item.


**2.** Where no directly applicable credit assessment exists for a certain item, but a credit assessment exists for a specific issuing programme or facility to which the item constituting the exposure does not belong or a general credit assessment exists for the issuer, then that credit assessment shall be used in either of the following cases:
- (a)the credit assessment produces a higher risk weight than would be the case if the exposure were treated as unrated and the exposure concerned:(i)is not a specialised lending exposure;(ii)ranks 
*pari passu* or junior in all respects to the specific issuing programme or facility or to senior unsecured exposures of that issuer, as relevant;
- (b)the credit assessment produces a lower risk weight than would be the case if the exposure were treated as unrated and the exposure concerned:(i)is not a specialised lending exposure;(ii)ranks 
*pari passu* or senior in all respects to the specific issuing programme or facility or to senior unsecured exposures of that issuer, as relevant.In all other cases, the exposure shall be treated as unrated.


**3.** Paragraphs 1 and 2 are not to prevent the application of Article 129.


**4.** Credit assessments for issuers within a corporate group cannot be used as credit assessment of another issuer within the same corporate group.


# Article 140

**Long-term and short-term credit assessments**

*Article 140*


**1.** Short-term credit assessments may only be used for short-term asset and off-balance sheet items constituting exposures to institutions and corporates.


**2.** Any short-term credit assessment shall only apply to the item the short-term credit assessment refers to, and it shall not be used to derive risk weights for any other item, except in the following cases:
- (a)if a short-term rated facility is assigned a 150 % risk weight, then all unrated unsecured exposures on that obligor whether short-term or long-term shall also be assigned a 150 % risk weight;
- (b)if a short-term rated facility is assigned a 50 % risk-weight, no unrated short-term exposure shall be assigned a risk weight lower than 100 %.


# Article 141

**Domestic and foreign currency items**

*Article 141*


**1.** A credit assessment that refers to an item denominated in the obligor’s domestic currency shall not be used to derive a risk weight for an exposure on that same obligor that is denominated in a foreign currency.


**2.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where an exposure arises through an institution’s participation in a loan that has been extended by, or has been guaranteed against convertibility and transfer risk by, a multilateral development bank listed in Article 117(2) the preferred creditor status of which is recognised in the market, the credit assessment on the obligor’s domestic currency item may be used to derive a risk weight for an exposure on that same obligor that is denominated in a foreign currency.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, where the exposure denominated in a foreign currency is guaranteed against convertibility and transfer risk, the credit assessment on the obligor’s domestic currency item may only be used for risk weighting purposes on the guaranteed part of that exposure. The part of that exposure that is not guaranteed shall be risk weighted based on a credit assessment on the obligor that refers to an item denominated in that foreign currency.

# Article 144

**Competent authorities' assessment of an application to use an IRB Approach**

*Article 144*


**1.** The competent authority shall grant permission pursuant to Article 143 for an institution to use the IRB Approach, including to use own estimates of LGD and conversion factors, only if the competent authority is satisfied that requirements laid down in this Chapter are met, in particular those laid down in Section 6, and that the systems of the institution for the management and rating of credit risk exposures are sound and implemented with integrity and, in particular, that the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the following standards are met:
- (a)the institution's rating systems provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk;
- (b)internal ratings and default and loss estimates used in the calculation of own funds requirements and associated systems and processes play an essential role in the risk management and decision-making process, and in the credit approval, internal capital allocation and corporate governance functions of the institution;
- (c)the institution has a credit risk control unit responsible for its rating systems that is appropriately independent and free from undue influence;
- (d)the institution collects and stores all relevant data to provide effective support to its credit risk measurement and management process;
- (e)the institution documents its rating systems and the rationale for their design and validates its rating systems;
- (f)the institution has validated each rating system during an appropriate period prior to the permission to use that rating system, has assessed during that period whether each rating system is suited to the range of application of that rating system, and has made the necessary changes to each rating system following from its assessment;
- (g)the institution has calculated under the IRB Approach the own funds requirements resulting from its risk parameters estimates and is able to submit the reporting as required by Article 430;
- (h)the institution has assigned and continues to assign each exposure in the range of application of a rating system to a rating grade or pool of that rating system.The requirements to use an IRB Approach, including own estimates of LGD and conversion factors, apply also where an institution has implemented a rating system, or model used within a rating system, that it has purchased from a third-party vendor.

# Article 145

**Prior experience of using IRB approaches**

*Article 145*


**1.** An institution applying to use the IRB Approach shall have been using for the IRB exposure classes in question rating systems that were broadly in line with the requirements set out in Section 6 for internal risk measurement and management purposes for at least three years prior to its qualification to use the IRB Approach.


**2.** An institution applying for the use of own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that it has been estimating and employing own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors in a manner that is broadly consistent with the requirements for use of own estimates of those parameters set out in Section 6 for at least three years prior to qualification to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors.


**3.** Where the institution extends the use of the IRB Approach subsequent to its initial permission, the experience of the institution shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 in respect of the additional exposures covered. If the use of rating systems is extended to exposures that are significantly different from the scope of the existing coverage, such that the existing experience cannot be reasonably assumed to be sufficient to meet the requirements of these provisions in respect of the additional exposures, then the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply separately for the additional exposures.

# Article 148

**Conditions for implementing the IRB Approach across different classes of exposure and business units**

*Article 148*


**1.** An institution that is permitted to apply the IRB Approach in accordance with Article 107(1) shall, together with any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries, implement the IRB Approach for at least one of the exposure classes referred to in Article 147(2), point (a), point (aa)(i) or (ii), point (b), point (c)(i), (ii) or (iii), point (d)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), or point (g). Once an institution has implemented the IRB Approach for a certain type of exposures within an exposure class, it shall do so for all exposures within that exposure class, unless it has received the permission of the competent authority to use the Standardised Approach permanently in accordance with Article 150.Subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, implementation of the IRB Approach may be carried out sequentially across the different types of exposures within a certain exposure class within the same business unit and across different business units in the same group, or for the use of own estimates of LGD or for the use of IRB-CCF.


**2.** Competent authorities shall determine the period over which an institution and any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries shall be required to implement the IRB Approach for all exposures within a certain exposure class across different types of exposures within the same business unit and across different business units in the same group, or for the use of own estimates of LGD or for the use of IRB-CCF. That period shall be one that competent authorities consider to be appropriate on the basis of the nature and scale of the activities of the institution concerned, or of any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries, and the number and nature of rating systems to be implemented.


**3.** Institutions shall carry out implementation of the IRB Approach in accordance with conditions determined by the competent authorities. The competent authority shall design those conditions in a way that they ensure that the flexibility under paragraph 1 is not used selectively for the purpose of achieving reduced own funds requirements in respect of those types of exposures or business units that are yet to be included in the IRB Approach or in the use of own estimates of LGD or in the use of IRB-CCF.


**4.** Institutions that have begun to use the IRB Approach only after 1 January 2013 or that have until that date been required by the competent authorities to be able to calculate their capital requirements using the Standardised Approach shall retain their ability to calculate capital requirements using the Standardised Approach for all their exposures during the implementation period until the competent authorities notify them that they are satisfied that the implementation of the IRB Approach will be completed with reasonable certainty.


**5.** An institution that is permitted to use the IRB Approach for any exposure class shall use the IRB Approach for the equity exposure class laid down in point (e) of Article 147(2), except where that institution is permitted to apply the Standardised Approach for equity exposures pursuant to Article 150 and for the other non credit-obligation assets exposure class laid down in point (g) of Article 147(2).


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which competent authorities shall determine the appropriate nature and timing of the sequential roll out of the IRB Approach across exposure classes referred to in paragraph 3.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 149

**Conditions to revert to the use of less sophisticated approaches**

*Article 149*


**1.** An institution that uses the IRB Approach for a particular exposure class or type of exposure shall not stop using that approach and use instead the Standardised Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts unless the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the use of the Standardised Approach is not made with a view to engaging in regulatory arbitrage, including by unduly reducing the own funds requirements of the institution, is necessary on the basis of the nature and complexity of the institution’s total exposures of that type and would not have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the institution or its ability to manage risk effectively;
- (b)the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority.


**2.** Institutions which have obtained permission under Article 151(9) to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors, shall not revert to the use of LGD values and conversion factors referred to in Article 151(8) unless the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the use of LGDs and conversion factors laid down in Article 151(8) for a certain exposure class or type of exposure is not proposed in order to reduce the own funds requirement of the institution, is necessary on the basis of nature and complexity of the institution's total exposures of this type and would not have a material adverse impact on the solvency of the institution or its ability to manage risk effectively;
- (b)the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority.


**3.** The application of paragraphs 1 and 2 is subject to the conditions for rolling out the IRB Approach determined by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 148 and the permission for permanent partial use referred to in Article 150.

- (b)exposures assigned to exposure classes or belonging to types of exposures within an exposure class, for which institutions have not received the prior permission of the competent authorities to use the IRB Approach for the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts.An institution that is permitted to use the IRB Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for a given exposure class may, subject to the competent authority’s prior permission, apply the Standardised Approach for some types of exposures within that exposure class, including exposures of foreign branches and different product groups, where those types of exposures are immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile.


**1a.** In addition to the exposures referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, an institution may, subject to the competent authority’s prior permission, apply the Standardised Approach for the following exposures where the IRB Approach is applied for other types of exposures within the same exposure class:
- (a)exposures to central governments and central banks of the Member States and their regional governments, local authorities, and public sector entities, provided that:(i)there is no difference in risk between the exposures to that central government and central bank and those other exposures because of specific public arrangements; and(ii)exposures to central governments and central banks are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Article 114(2) or (4);
- (b)exposures of an institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary or a subsidiary of its parent undertaking, provided that the counterparty is an institution or a financial holding company, mixed financial holding company, financial institution, asset management company or ancillary services undertaking subject to appropriate prudential requirements or an undertaking linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;
- (c)exposures between institutions which meet the requirements set out in Article 113(7).An institution that is permitted to use the IRB Approach for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for only some types of exposures within an exposure class shall apply the Standardised Approach for the remaining types of exposures within that exposure class.In addition to the exposures referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph, of this Article and in this paragraph, an institution may apply the Standardised Approach for exposures to churches and religious communities which meet the requirements set out in Article 115(3).

**9.** For the exposures referred to in paragraph 8, second subparagraph, of this Article, the competent authority shall permit institutions to use own estimates of LGD, and IRB-CCF where applicable pursuant to Article 166(8) and (8b), in accordance with Article 143 and Section 6.


**10.** The risk-weighted exposure amounts for securitised exposures and for exposures belonging to the exposure class referred to in point (f) of Article 147(2) shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 5.


**11.** For exposures in the form of shares or units in a CIU belonging to the exposure class referred to in Article 147(2), point (ea), institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Article 152, unless those exposures are deducted from own funds or are subject to the treatment set out in Article 72e(5), first subparagraph.


# Article 152

**Treatment of exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs**

*Article 152*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, calculated in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2 and 5, with the percentage of units or shares held by those institutions.


**2.** Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU shall look through to those underlying exposures to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, risk weighting all underlying exposures of the CIU as if they were directly held by the institutions.


**3.** By way of derogation from Article 92(4), point (e), institutions that calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article may calculate the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative exposures of that CIU as an amount equal to 50 % of the own funds requirement for those derivative exposures calculated in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 3, 4 or 5, of this Title, as applicable.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivative exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were incurred directly by the institution.


**4.** Institutions that apply the look-through approach in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article and that do not use the methods set out in this Chapter or in Chapter 5, as applicable, for all or parts of the underlying exposures of the CIU shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for all or those parts of the underlying exposures in accordance with the following principles:

- (b)for exposures assigned to the items representing securitisation positions referred to in Article 147(2), point (f), institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Article 254 as if those exposures were directly held by those institutions;
- (c)for all other underlying exposures, institutions shall apply the Standardised Approach laid down in Chapter 2.


**5.** Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for those exposures in accordance with the mandate-based approach set out in Article 132a(2). However, for the exposures listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 of this Article, institutions shall apply the approaches set out therein.


**6.** Subject to Article 132b(2), institutions that do not apply the look-through approach in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article or the mandate-based approach in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article shall apply the fall-back approach referred to in Article 132(2).


**7.** Institutions may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by using a combination of the approaches referred to in this Article, provided that the conditions for using those approaches are met.


**8.** Institutions that do not have adequate data or information to calculate the risk-weighted amount of a CIU in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 may rely on the calculations of a third party, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the third party is one of the following:(i)the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;(ii)for CIUs not covered by point (i) of this point, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of Article 132(3);
- (b)for exposures other than those listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 of this Article, the third party carries out the calculation in accordance with the look-through approach set out in Article 132a(1);
- (c)for exposures listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4, the third party carries out the calculation in accordance with the approaches set out therein;
- (d)an external auditor has confirmed the correctness of the third party's calculation.Institutions that rely on third-party calculations shall multiply the risk weighted exposure amounts of a CIU's exposures resulting from those calculations by a factor of 1,2.By way of derogation from the second subparagraph, where the institution has unrestricted access to the detailed calculations carried out by the third party, the 1,2 factor shall not apply. The institution shall provide those calculations to its competent authority upon request.


**9.** For the purposes of this Article, Article 132(5) and (6) and Article 132b shall apply. For the purposes of this Article, Article 132c shall apply, using the risk weights calculated in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Title.


# Article 153

**Risk-weighted exposure amounts for exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates**

*Article 153*


**1.** Subject to the application of the specific treatments laid down in paragraphs 2 and 4, the risk-weighted exposure amounts for exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates shall be calculated according to the following formulae:
*Risk – weighted exposure amount = RW · exposure value*where the risk weight RW is defined as
- (i)if PD = 0, RW shall be 0;
- (ii)if PD = 1, i.e., for defaulted exposures:where institutions apply the LGD values set out in Article 161(1), RW shall be 0;where institutions use own estimates of LGDs, RW shall be 
$$RW = \max
(0;12.5 \times 
\left(LGD  -  EL
_{BE}\right))$$
;where the expected loss best estimate (hereinafter referred to as "ELBE") shall be the institution's best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1)(h);
- (iii)if 0 < PD < 1, then:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.006901.fmx.tif]*

  where:
- **N**: = the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable, i.e. N(x) equals the probability that a normal random variable with mean of 0 and variance of 1, is less than or equal to x;
- **G**: = the inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable, i.e. if x = G(z), x is the value such that N(x) = z;
- **R**: = the coefficient of correlation, which is defined as:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.006902.fmx.tif]*

  
- **b**: = the maturity adjustment factor, which is defined as:
*b = [0,11852 – 0,05478 ‏‏‏· ln(PD)]2*;
- **M**: = the maturity, expressed in years and determined in accordance with Article 162.


**2.** For exposures to large regulated financial sector entities and to unregulated financial sector entities, the coefficient of correlation R referred to in paragraph 1, point (iii), or paragraph 4, as applicable, shall be multiplied by 1,25 when calculating the risk weights of those exposures.


**3.** The risk-weighted exposure amount for each exposure which meets the requirements set out in Articles 202 and 217 may be adjusted in accordance with the following formula:
*Risk – weighted exposure amount = RW · exposure value* · (0.15 + 160 · 
*PDpp*)where:
- **PDpp**=PD of the protection provider.RW shall be calculated using the relevant risk weight formula set out in point 1 for the exposure, the PD of the obligor and the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider. The maturity factor (b) shall be calculated using the lower of the PD of the protection provider and the PD of the obligor.


**4.** For exposures to companies where the total annual sales for the consolidated group of which the firm is a part is less than EUR 50 million, institutions may use the following correlation formula in paragraph 1 (iii) for the calculation of risk weights for corporate exposures. In this formula S is expressed as total annual sales in millions of euro with EUR 5 million ≤ S ≤ EUR 50 million. Reported sales of less than EUR 5 million shall be treated as if they were equivalent to EUR 5 million. For purchased receivables the total annual sales shall be the weighted average by individual exposures of the pool.
$$R = 0.12  \times 
\frac{1  - e
^{ - 50  \times PD}}{1  - e
^{ - 50}} + 0.24  \times 
\left(1  - 
\frac{1  - e
^{ - 50  \times PD}}{1  - e
^{ - 50}}\right) - 0.04  \times 
\left(1  - 
\frac{\min
(\max
(5,S),50) -  5}{45}\right)$$
Institutions shall substitute total assets of the consolidated group for total annual sales when total annual sales are not a meaningful indicator of firm size and total assets are a more meaningful indicator than total annual sales.


**5.** For specialised lending exposures in respect of which an institution is not able to estimate PDs or the institutions' PD estimates do not meet the requirements set out in Section 6, the institution shall assign risk weights to these exposures in accordance with Table 1, as follows:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remaining Maturity | Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Category 4 | Category 5 | 
| Less than 2,5 years | 50 % | 70 % | 115 % | 250 % | 0 % | 
| Equal or more than 2,5 years | 70 % | 90 % | 115 % | 250 % | 0 % | In assigning risk weights to specialised lending exposures institutions shall take into account the following factors: financial strength, political and legal environment, transaction and/or asset characteristics, strength of the sponsor and developer, including any public private partnership income stream, and security package.


**6.** For their purchased corporate receivables institutions shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184. For purchased corporate receivables that comply in addition with the conditions set out in Article 154(5), and where it would be unduly burdensome for an institution to use the risk quantification standards for corporate exposures as set out in Section 6 for these receivables, the risk quantification standards for retail exposures as set out in Section 6 may be used.


**7.** For purchased corporate receivables, refundable purchase price discounts, collaterals or partial guarantees that provide first loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as a first loss protection by the purchaser of the receivables or by the beneficiary of the collateral or of the partial guarantee in accordance with Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 3 of Chapter 5. The seller providing the refundable purchase price discount and the provider of a collateral or a partial guarantee shall treat those as an exposure to a first loss position in accordance with Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 3 of Chapter 5.


**8.** Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures subject to the condition that the nth default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the risk weights of the exposures included in the basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures, where the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk-weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the nominal amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative multiplied by 12,5. The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation. A 1 250 % risk weight shall apply to positions in a basket for which an institution cannot determine the risk-weight under the IRB Approach.


**9.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions are to take into account the factors referred to in paragraph 5, second subparagraph, when assigning risk weights to specialised lending exposures.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 154

**Risk-weighted exposure amounts for retail exposures**

*Article 154*


**1.** The risk-weighted exposure amounts for retail exposures shall be calculated in accordance with the following formulae:
*Risk – weighted exposure amount = RW · exposure value*where the risk weight RW is defined as follows:
- (i)if PD = 1, i.e., for defaulted exposures, RW shall be
$$RW = \max
(0;12.5  \times 
\left(LGD  -  EL
_{BE}\right))$$
;where ELBE shall be the institution's best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1)(h);
- (ii)if PD < 1, then:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.006903.fmx.tif]*

  where:
- **N**: = the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable, i.e. N(x) equals the probability that a normal random variable with mean of 0 and variance of 1, is less than or equal to x;
- **G**: = the inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable, i.e. if x = G(z), x is the value such that N(x) = z;
- **R**: = the coefficient of correlation, which is defined as:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.007001.fmx.tif]*


**2.** The risk-weighted exposure amount for each exposure to an SME as referred to in Article 147(5) which meets the requirements set out in Articles 202 and 217 may be calculated in accordance with Article 153(3).


**3.** For retail exposures that are not in default and are secured or partially secured by residential property, a coefficient of correlation R of 0,15 shall replace the figure produced by the coefficient of correlation formula in paragraph 1.The risk weight calculated for an exposure partially secured by residential property pursuant to paragraph 1, point (ii), taking into account a coefficient of correlation R as set out in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, shall be applied both to the secured and the unsecured part of that exposure.


**4.** For QRREs that are not in default, a coefficient of correlation R of 0,04 shall replace the figure produced by the coefficient of correlation formula in paragraph 1.Competent authorities shall review the relative volatility of loss rates across QRREs belonging to the same type of exposures, as well as across the aggregate QRRE exposure class, and shall share information on the typical characteristics of qualifying revolving retail loss rates with Member States and with EBA.


**5.** To be eligible for the retail treatment, purchased receivables shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 184 and the following conditions:
- (a)the institution has purchased the receivables from unrelated third party sellers, and its exposure to the obligor of the receivable does not include any exposures that are directly or indirectly originated by the institution itself;
- (b)the purchased receivables shall be generated on an arm's-length basis between the seller and the obligor. As such, inter-company accounts receivables and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other are ineligible;
- (c)the purchasing institution has a claim on all proceeds from the purchased receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds; and
- (d)the portfolio of purchased receivables is sufficiently diversified.


**6.** For purchased retail receivables, refundable purchase price discounts, collaterals or partial guarantees that provide first loss protection for default losses, dilution losses, or both, may be treated as a first loss protection by the purchaser of the receivables or by the beneficiary of the collateral or of the partial guarantee in accordance with Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 3 of Chapter 5. The seller providing the refundable purchase price discount and the provider of a collateral or a partial guarantee shall treat those as an exposure to a first loss position in accordance with Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 3 of Chapter 5.


**7.** For hybrid pools of purchased retail receivables where purchasing institutions cannot separate exposures secured by immovable property collateral and qualifying revolving retail exposures from other retail exposures, the retail risk weight function producing the highest capital requirements for those exposures shall apply.


# Article 155

**Risk-weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures**

*Article 155*


**1.** Institutions shall determine their risk-weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures, excluding those deducted in accordance with Part Two or subject to a 250 % risk weight in accordance with Article 48, in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article. An institution may apply different approaches to different equity portfolios where the institution itself uses different approaches for internal risk management purposes. Where an institution uses different approaches, the choice of the PD/LGD approach or the internal models approach shall be made consistently, including over time and with the approach used for the internal risk management of the relevant equity exposure, and shall not be determined by regulatory arbitrage considerations.Institutions may treat equity exposures to ancillary services undertakings in accordance with the treatment of other non credit- obligation assets.


**2.** Under the simple risk weight approach, the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be calculated in accordance with the formula:
*Risk – weighted exposure amount = RW * exposure value*,where:
- **Risk weight (RW)**=190 % for private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios.
- **Risk weight (RW)**=290 % for exchange traded equity exposures.
- **Risk weight (RW)**=370 % for all other equity exposures.Short cash positions and derivative instruments held in the non-trading book are permitted to offset long positions in the same individual stocks provided that these instruments have been explicitly designated as hedges of specific equity exposures and that they provide a hedge for at least another year. Other short positions are to be treated as if they are long positions with the relevant risk weight assigned to the absolute value of each position. In the context of maturity mismatched positions, the method is that for corporate exposures as set out in Article 162(5).Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4.


**3.** Under the PD/LGD approach, risk-weighted exposure amounts shall be calculated according to the formulas in Article 153(1). If institutions do not have sufficient information to use the definition of default set out in Article 178, a scaling factor of 1,5 shall be assigned to the risk weights.At the individual exposure level the sum of the expected loss amount multiplied by 12,5 and the risk-weighted exposure amount shall not exceed the exposure value multiplied by 12,5.Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity exposure in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4. This shall be subject to an LGD of 90 % on the exposure to the provider of the hedge. For private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios an LGD of 65 % may be used. For these purposes M shall be five years.


**4.** Under the internal models approach, the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be the potential loss on the institution's equity exposures as derived using internal value-at-risk models subject to the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval of the difference between quarterly returns and an appropriate risk-free rate computed over a long-term sample period, multiplied by 12,5. The risk-weighted exposure amounts at the equity portfolio level shall not be less than the total of the sums of the following:
- (a)the risk-weighted exposure amounts required under the PD/LGD Approach; and
- (b)the corresponding expected loss amounts multiplied by 12,5.The amounts referred to in point (a) and (b) shall be calculated on the basis of the PD values set out in Article 165(1) and the corresponding LGD values set out in Article 165(2).Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on an equity position.


# Article 156

**Risk-weighted exposure amounts for other non credit-obligation assets**

*Article 156*

The risk-weighted exposure amounts for other non credit-obligation assets shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
*Risk* – 
*weighted exposure amount* = 100 % · 
*exposure value*,except for:
- (a)cash in hand and equivalent cash items as well as gold bullion held in own vault or on an allocated basis to the extent backed by bullion liabilities, in which case a 0 % risk-weight shall be assigned;
- (b)when the exposure is a residual value of leased assets in which case it shall be calculated as follows:
$$
\frac{1}{t} \times  100 %  \times exposure value$$

**2.** For purchased corporate receivables in respect of which an institution is not able to estimate PDs or an institution's PD estimates do not meet the requirements set out in Section 6, the PDs for these exposures shall be determined in accordance with the following methods:
- (a)for senior claims on purchased corporate receivables PD shall be the institutions estimate of EL divided by LGD for these receivables;
- (b)for subordinated claims on purchased corporate receivables PD shall be the institution's estimate of EL;
- (c)an institution that has received the permission of the competent authority to use own LGD estimates for corporate exposures pursuant to Article 143 and that can decompose its EL estimates for purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner that the competent authority considers to be reliable, may use the PD estimate that results from this decomposition.


**3.** The PD of obligors in default shall be 100 %.


**4.** For an exposure covered by an unfunded credit protection, an institution using own estimates of LGD under Article 143 for both the exposure that is covered by the unfunded credit protection and for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider may recognise the unfunded credit protection in the PD in accordance with Article 183.


**5.** Institutions using own LGD estimates may recognise unfunded credit protection by adjusting PDs subject to Article 161(3).


**6.** For dilution risk of purchased corporate receivables, PD shall be set equal to the EL estimates of the institution for dilution risk. An institution that has received permission from the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own estimates of LGD for corporate exposures that can decompose its EL estimates for dilution risk of purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner that the competent authority considers to be reliable, may use the PD estimates that result from that decomposition. Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection in the PD in accordance with Chapter 4.

*Article 161*


**1.** Institutions shall use the following LGD values:
- (a)senior exposures without eligible funded credit protection to central governments and central banks, to financial sector entities and to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities: 45 %;
- (aa)senior exposures without eligible funded credit protection to corporates which are not financial sector entities: 40 %;
- (b)subordinated exposures without eligible collateral: 75 %;
- (c)institutions may recognise funded and unfunded credit protection in the LGD in accordance with Chapter 4;

**2.** For dilution and default risk if an institution has received permission from the competent authority to use own LGD estimates for corporate exposures pursuant to Article 143 and it can decompose its EL estimates for purchased corporate receivables into PDs and LGDs in a manner the competent authority considers to be reliable, the LGD estimate for purchased corporate receivables may be used.


**3.** For an exposure covered by an unfunded credit protection, an institution using own estimates of LGD pursuant to Article 143 for both the exposure that is covered by an unfunded credit protection and for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider may recognise the unfunded credit protection in the LGD in accordance with Article 183.


**4.** For exposures assigned to the exposure classes referred to in Article 147(2), point (c)(i), (ii) or (iii), for the sole purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and the expected loss amounts of those exposures, and in particular for the purposes of Article 153(1), point (iii), Article 157, and Article 158(1), (5) and (10), where own estimates of LGD are used, the LGD values for each exposure used as an input of the risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss formulae shall not be less than the following LGD input floor values, calculated in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article.

| Column 1 | 
| --- |
| LGD input floors (LGDfloor) for exposures belonging to the exposure classes referred to in Article 147(2), point (c)(i), (ii) or (iii) | 
| Exposure without eligible FCP (LGDU-floor) | Exposure fully secured by eligible FCP (LGDS-floor) | 
| 25 % | financial collateral | 0 % | 
| receivables | 10 % | 
| residential property or commercial immovable property | 10 % | 
| other physical collateral | 15 % |


**5.** For exposures assigned to the exposure classes referred to in Article 147(2), point (aa)(i) or (ii), for the sole purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and the expected loss amounts of those exposures, and in particular for the purposes of Article 153(1), point (iii), Article 157, and Article 158(1), (5) and (10), where own estimates of LGD are used, the LGD value used as an input of the risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss formulae for exposures without eligible FCP shall not be less than the following LGD input floor value: 5 %.


**6.** For the purposes of paragraph 4 of this Article, the LGD input floors in Table 1 in that paragraph for exposures fully secured by eligible funded credit protection shall apply when the value of the funded credit protection, after the application of the volatility adjustments Hc and Hfx concerned in accordance with Article 230, is equal to or exceeds the value of the underlying exposure.For the purposes of paragraph 4 of this Article and for the purposes of the application of the relevant related adjustments, Hc and Hfx, in accordance with Article 230, funded credit protection shall be eligible pursuant to this Chapter. In that case, the type of funded credit protection "other physical collateral" in Article 230, Table 1, shall be understood as "other physical and other eligible collateral".The applicable LGD input floor (LGDfloor) for an exposure partially secured by FCP is calculated as the weighted average of LGDU-floor for the part of the exposure without FCP and LGDS-floor for the fully secured part, as follows:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.007301.fmx.tif]*

  where:LGDU-floor and LGDS-floor are the relevant floor values in Table 1;E, ES, EU and HE are determined in accordance with Article 230.


**7.** Where an institution that uses own estimates of LGD for a given type of unsecured exposures to corporates and unsecured exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities is not able to take into account the effect of the funded credit protection securing one of the exposures of that type of exposures in the own estimate of LGD due to lack of data on recoveries for that funded credit protection, the institution shall be permitted to apply the formula set out in Article 230, with the exception that the LGDU in that formula shall be the institution’s own estimate of LGD for unsecured exposures. In that case, the funded credit protection shall be eligible in accordance with Chapter 4 and the institution’s own estimate of LGD used as LGDU shall be calculated based on underlying loss data excluding any recoveries arising from that funded credit protection.


# Article 162

**Maturity**

*Article 162*


**1.** For exposures for which an institution has not received permission from the competent authority to use own estimates of LGD, the maturity value (M) shall be applied consistently and, either be set at 2,5 years, except for exposures arising from securities financing transactions, for which M shall be 0,5 years, or, alternatively, be calculated in accordance with paragraph 2.


**2.** For exposures for which an institution applies own estimates of LGD, the maturity value (M) shall be calculated using periods expressed in years, as set out in this paragraph and subject to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this Article. M shall be no greater than five years, except in the cases specified in Article 384(2) where M as specified therein shall be used. M shall be calculated as follows in each of the following cases:
- (a)for an instrument subject to a cash flow schedule, M shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
$$M = \max
(1,min
(
\frac{
\sum
_{t}t  \times  CF
_{t}}{
\sum
_{t}CF
_{t}},5))$$
where CFt denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the obligor in period t;
- (b)for derivatives subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the exposure, where M shall be at least 1 year, and the notional amount of each exposure shall be used for weighting the maturity;
- (c)for exposures arising from fully or nearly-fully collateralised derivative instruments listed in Annex II and fully or nearly-fully collateralised margin lending transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least 10 days;
- (d)for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least five days. The notional amount of each transaction shall be used for weighting the maturity;
- (da)for secured lending transactions which are subject to a master netting agreement, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least 20 days; the notional amount of each transaction shall be used for weighting the maturity;
- (db)for a master netting agreement including more than one of the transaction types corresponding to point (c), (d) or (da) of this paragraph, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions where M shall be at least the longest holding period, expressed in years, applicable to such transactions as provided for in Article 224(2), either 10 days or 20 days, depending on the cases; the notional amount of each transaction shall be used for weighting the maturity;
- (e)an institution that has received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own PD estimates for purchased corporate receivables, for drawn amounts M shall equal the purchased receivables exposure weighted average maturity, where M shall be at least 90 days. This same value of M shall also be used for undrawn amounts under a committed purchase facility provided that the facility contains effective covenants, early amortisation triggers, or other features that protect the purchasing institution against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility's term. Absent such effective protections, M for undrawn amounts shall be calculated as the sum of the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement and the remaining maturity of the purchase facility, where M shall be at least 90 days;
- (f)for any instrument other than those referred to in this paragraph or when an institution is not in a position to calculate M as set out in point (a), M shall be the maximum remaining time, in years, that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, including the principal, interest, and fees, where M shall be at least one year;
- (g)for institutions using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6 of Chapter 6 to calculate the exposure values, M shall be calculated for exposures to which they apply this method and for which the maturity of the longest-dated contract contained in the netting set is greater than one year in accordance with the following formula:
$$M = \min

;
- (h)an institution that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) may use, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, the effective credit duration estimated by the internal model as M.Subject to paragraph 2, for netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year the formula in point (a) shall apply;
- (i)for institutions using the approaches referred to in Article 382a(1), point (a) or (b), to calculate the own funds requirements for the CVA risk of transactions with a given counterparty, M shall be no greater than 1 in the formula set out in Article 153(1), point (iii), for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty risk for the same transactions, as referred to in Article 92(4), point (a) or (g), as applicable;
- (j)for revolving exposures, M shall be determined using the maximum contractual termination date of the facility; institutions shall not use the repayment date of the current drawing if that date is not the maximum contractual termination date of the facility.


**3.** Where the documentation requires daily re-margining and daily revaluation and includes provisions that allow for the prompt liquidation or set off of collateral in the event of default or failure to remargin, M shall be the weighted average remaining maturity of the transactions and M shall be at least one day for:
- (a)fully or nearly-fully collateralised derivative instruments listed in Annex II;
- (b)fully or nearly-fully collateralised margin lending transactions;
- (c)repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions.In addition, for qualifying short-term exposures which are not part of the institution's ongoing financing of the obligor, M shall be at least one-day. Qualifying short term exposures shall include the following:
- (a)exposures to institutions or investment firms arising from the settlement of foreign exchange obligations;
- (b)self-liquidating short-term trade finance transactions and corporate purchased receivables, provided that the respective exposures have a residual maturity of up to one year;
- (c)exposures arising from settlement of securities purchases and sales within the usual delivery period or two business days;
- (d)exposures arising from cash settlements by wire transfer and settlements of electronic payment transactions and prepaid cost, including overdrafts arising from failed transactions that do not exceed a short, fixed agreed number of business days;
- (e)issued as well as confirmed letters of credit that are short term, that is, they have a maturity below one year, and are self-liquidating.


**4.** For exposures to corporates established in the Union which are not large corporates, institutions may choose to set for all such exposures M as set out in paragraph 1 instead of applying paragraph 2.


**5.** Maturity mismatches shall be treated as specified in Chapter 4.


**6.** For the purpose of expressing in years the minimum numbers of days referred to in paragraph 2, points (c) to (db), and paragraph 3, the minimum numbers of days shall be divided by 365,25.

**2.** Institutions using own estimates of LGD pursuant to Article 143 for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider may recognise the unfunded credit protection in the LGD in accordance with Article 183.


**3.** For the purposes of Article 154(2), the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider referred to in Article 153(3) shall either be the LGD associated with an unhedged facility to the guarantor or the unhedged facility of the obligor, depending upon whether, in the event both the guarantor and obligor default during the life of the hedged transaction, available evidence and the structure of the guarantee indicate that the amount recovered would depend on the financial condition of the guarantor or obligor, respectively.


**4.** For the sole purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for retail exposures, and in particular pursuant to Article 154(1), point (ii), Article 157, and Article 158(1), (5) and (10), the LGD values for each exposure used as an input of the risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss formulae shall not be less than the LGD input floor values set out in Table 1, calculated in accordance with paragraph 4a of this Article:

In particular, authorities shall be required to cooperate closely and to share all the information that may be necessary for the adequate performance of the duties imposed upon the designated authority pursuant to this Article. That cooperation shall aim at avoiding any form of duplicative or inconsistent action between the competent authority and the designated authority, as well as ensuring that the interaction with other measures, in particular measures taken under Article 458 of this Regulation and Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU, is duly taken into account.


**6.** Based on the data collected under Article 430a and on any other relevant indicators, and taking into account forward-looking immovable property market developments the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article shall periodically, and at least annually, assess whether the LGD input floor values referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article are appropriate for retail exposures secured by residential property or other retail exposures secured by residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority.Where, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 concludes that the LGD input floor values referred to in paragraph 4 are not adequate, and if it considers that the inadequacy of LGD input floor values could adversely affect current or future financial stability in its Member State, it may set higher LGD input floor values for those exposures located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority. Those higher LGD input floor values may also be applied at the level of one or more property segments of such exposures.The authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 shall notify EBA and the ESRB before making the decision referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph. Within one month of receipt of that notification, EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned. EBA and the ESRB shall publish the higher LGD input floor values referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.


**7.** Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 sets higher LGD input floor values pursuant to paragraph 6, institutions shall have a six-month transitional period to apply them.


**8.** EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 shall take into account when assessing the appropriateness of LGD values as part of the assessment referred to in paragraph 6.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2019.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**9.** The ESRB may, by means of recommendations in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, and in close cooperation with EBA, give guidance to authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article on the following:
- (a)factors which could "adversely affect current or future financial stability" referred to in paragraph 6; and
- (b)indicative benchmarks that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 is to take into account when determining higher minimum LGD values.


**10.** The institutions of a Member State shall apply the higher minimum LGD values that have been determined by the authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 6 to all their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that Member State.

**1.** PDs shall be determined in accordance with the methods for corporate exposures.The following minimum PDs shall apply:
- (a)0,09 % for exchange traded equity exposures where the investment is part of a long-term customer relationship;
- (b)0,09 % for non-exchange traded equity exposures where the returns on the investment are based on regular and periodic cash flows not derived from capital gains;
- (c)0,40 % for exchange traded equity exposures including other short positions as set out in Article 155(2);
- (d)1,25 % for all other equity exposures including other short positions as set out in Article 155(2).


**2.** Private equity exposures in sufficiently diversified portfolios may be assigned an LGD of 65 %. All other such exposures shall be assigned an LGD of 90 %.


**3.** M assigned to all exposures shall be five years.


# Article 166

**Exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities and retail exposures**

*Article 166*


**1.** Unless noted otherwise, the exposure value of on-balance sheet exposures shall be the accounting value measured without taking into account any credit risk adjustments made.This rule also applies to assets purchased at a price different than the amount owed.For purchased assets, the difference between the amount owed and the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments have been applied that has been recorded on the balance-sheet of the institutions when purchasing the asset is denoted discount if the amount owed is larger, and premium if it is smaller.


**2.** Where institutions use master netting agreements in relation to repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 4 or 6.


**3.** In order to calculate the exposure value for on-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits, institutions shall apply the methods set out in Chapter 4.


**4.** The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments shall comprise the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option (i.e. option the exercise of which is reasonably certain). If a party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment related to the residual value of a leased asset and this payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions in Article 201 regarding the eligibility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising other types of guarantees provided in Article 213, the payment obligation may be taken into account as unfunded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4.


**5.** In the case of any contract listed in Annex II, the exposure value shall be determined by the methods set out in Chapter 6 and shall not take into account any credit risk adjustment made.


**6.** The exposure value for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts of purchased receivables shall be the value determined in accordance with paragraph 1 minus the own funds requirements for dilution risk prior to credit risk mitigation.


**7.** Where an exposure takes the form of securities or commodities sold, posted or lent under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions, the exposure value shall be the value of the securities or commodities determined in accordance with Article 24. Where the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method as set out under Article 223 is used, the exposure value shall be increased by the volatility adjustment appropriate to such securities or commodities, as set out therein. The exposure value of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions may be determined either in accordance with Chapter 6 or Article 220(2).


**8.** The exposure value of off-balance-sheet items which are not contracts as listed in Annex II shall be calculated by using either IRB-CCF or SA-CCFs, in accordance with paragraphs 8a and 8b of this Article and Article 151(8).Where only the drawn balances of revolving facilities have been securitised, institutions shall ensure that they continue to hold the required amount of own funds against the undrawn balances associated with the securitisation.An institution that has not received permission to use IRB-CCF shall calculate the exposure value as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by the SA-CCF concerned.An institution that uses IRB-CCF shall calculate the exposure value for undrawn commitments as the undrawn amount multiplied by IRB-CCF.


**8a.** For an exposure for which an institution has not received permission to use IRB-CCF, the applicable CCF shall be the SA-CCF as provided for in Chapter 2 for the same types of items as laid down in Article 111. The amount to which the SA-CCF is to be applied shall be the lower of the value of the committed but undrawn amount and the value that reflects any possible constraining of the availability of the facility, including the existence of an upper limit on the potential lending amount which is related to an obligor’s reported cash flow. Where a facility is constrained in that way, the institution shall have sufficient line monitoring and management procedures to support the existence of that constraining.


**8b.** Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions that meet the requirements for the use of IRB-CCF as specified in Section 6 shall use IRB-CCF for exposures arising from undrawn revolving commitments treated under the IRB Approach provided that those exposures would not be subject to a SA-CCF of 100 % under the Standardised Approach. SA-CCFs shall be used for:
- (a)all other off-balance-sheet items, in particular undrawn non-revolving commitments;
- (b)exposures where the minimum requirements for calculating IRB-CCF as specified in Section 6 are not met by the institution or where the competent authority has not permitted the use of IRB-CCF.For the purposes of this Article, a commitment shall be deemed "revolving" where it lets an obligor obtain a loan where the obligor has the flexibility to decide how often to withdraw from the loan and at what intervals, allowing the obligor to drawdown, repay and redraw loans advanced to it. Contractual arrangements that allow prepayments and subsequent redraws of those prepayments shall be considered revolving.


**8c.** Where IRB-CCF are used for the sole purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts of exposures arising from revolving commitments other than exposures assigned to the exposure class in accordance with Article 147(2), point (a), in particular pursuant to Article 153(1), Article 157 and Article 158(1), (5) and (10), the exposure value for each exposure used as an input of the risk-weighted exposure amount and expected loss formulae shall not be less than the sum of:
- (a)the drawn amount of the revolving commitment;
- (b)50 % of the off-balance exposure amount of the remaining undrawn part of the revolving commitment calculated using the applicable SA-CCF provided for in Article 111.The sum of points (a) and (b) shall be referred to as the "CCF input floor".


**9.** Where a commitment refers to the extension of another commitment, the lower of the two conversion factors associated with the individual commitment shall be used.


**10.** For all off-balance sheet items other than those mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 8, the exposure value shall be the following percentage of its value:
- (a)100 % if it is a full risk item;
- (b)50 % if it is a medium-risk item;
- (c)20 % if it is a medium/low-risk item;
- (d)0 % if it is a low-risk item.For the purposes of this paragraph the off-balance sheet items shall be assigned to risk categories as indicated in Annex I.


# Article 167

**Equity exposures**

*Article 167*


**1.** The exposure value of equity exposures shall be the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustment have been applied.


**2.** The exposure value of off-balance sheet equity exposures shall be its nominal value after reducing its nominal value by specific credit risk adjustments for this exposure.


# Article 168

**Other non credit-obligation assets**

*Article 168*

The exposure value of other non credit-obligation assets shall be the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustment have been applied
# Article 169

**General principles**

*Article 169*


**1.** Where an institution uses multiple rating systems, the rationale for assigning an obligor or a transaction to a rating system shall be documented and applied in a manner that appropriately reflects the level of risk.


**2.** Assignment criteria and processes shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain appropriate for the current portfolio and external conditions.


**3.** Where an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters for individual obligors or exposures these may be seen as estimates assigned to grades on a continuous rating scale.EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on how to apply in practice the requirements on model design, risk quantification, validation and application of risk parameters using continuous or very granular rating scales for each risk parameter.


# Article 170

**Structure of rating systems**

*Article 170*


**1.** The structure of rating systems for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, and regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities shall comply with the following requirements:
- (a)a rating system shall take into account obligor and transaction risk characteristics;
- (b)a rating system shall have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default. The obligor rating scale shall have a minimum of 7 grades for non-defaulted obligors and one for defaulted obligors;
- (c)an institution shall document the relationship between obligor grades in terms of the level of default risk each grade implies and the criteria used to distinguish that level of default risk;
- (d)institutions with portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk shall have enough obligor grades within that range to avoid undue concentrations of obligors in a particular grade. Significant concentrations within a single grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the obligor grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band and that the default risk posed by all obligors in the grade falls within that band;
- (e)to be permitted by the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs for own funds requirement calculation, a rating system shall incorporate a distinct facility rating scale which exclusively reflects LGD related transaction characteristics. The facility grade definition shall include both a description of how exposures are assigned to the grade and of the criteria used to distinguish the level of risk across grades;
- (f)significant concentrations within a single facility grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the facility grade covers a reasonably narrow LGD band, respectively, and that the risk posed by all exposures in the grade falls within that band.


**2.** Institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures are exempt from the requirement to have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default for these exposures. These institutions shall have for these exposures at least four grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one grade for defaulted obligors.


**3.** The structure of rating systems for retail exposures shall comply with the following requirements:
- (a)rating systems shall reflect both obligor and transaction risk, and shall capture all relevant obligor and transaction characteristics;
- (b)the level of risk differentiation shall ensure that the number of exposures in a given grade or pool is sufficient to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics at the grade or pool level. The distribution of exposures and obligors across grades or pools shall be such as to avoid excessive concentrations;
- (c)the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools shall provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and shall allow for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at grade or pool level. For purchased receivables the grouping shall reflect the seller's underwriting practices and the heterogeneity of its customers.


**4.** Institutions shall consider the following risk drivers when assigning exposures to grades or pools:
- (a)obligor risk characteristics;
- (b)transaction risk characteristics, including product and funded credit protection types, recognised unfunded credit protection, loan-to-value measures, seasoning and seniority; institutions shall explicitly address cases where several exposures benefit from the same funded or unfunded credit protection;
- (c)delinquency, except where an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authority that delinquency is not a material driver of risk for the exposure.


# Article 171

**Assignment to grades or pools**

*Article 171*


**1.** An institution shall have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools within a rating system that comply with the following requirements:
- (a)the grade or pool definitions and criteria shall be sufficiently detailed to allow those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign obligors or facilities posing similar risk to the same grade or pool. This consistency shall exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations;
- (b)the documentation of the rating process shall allow third parties to understand the assignments of exposures to grades or pools, to replicate grade and pool assignments and to evaluate the appropriateness of the assignments to a grade or a pool;
- (c)the criteria shall also be consistent with the institution's internal lending standards and its policies for handling troubled obligors and facilities.


**2.** An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools. If an institution uses an external rating as a primary factor determining an internal rating assignment, the institution shall ensure that it considers other relevant information.


**3.** Institutions shall use a time horizon longer than one year in assigning ratings. An obligor rating shall represent the institution’s assessment of the obligor’s ability and willingness to contractually perform despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events. Rating systems shall be designed in such a way that idiosyncratic changes and, where they are material drivers of risk for the type of exposure, industry-specific changes are a driver of migrations from one grade or pool to another. Business cycle effects may also be a driver of migrations.


# Article 172

**Assignment of exposures**

*Article 172*


**1.** For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, the assignment of exposures shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria:
- (a)each obligor shall be assigned to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process;
- (b)for those exposures for which an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors pursuant to Article 143, each exposure shall also be assigned to a facility grade as part of the credit approval process;
- (c)institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures shall assign each of these exposures to a grade in accordance with Article 170(2);
- (d)each separate legal entity to which the institution is exposed shall be separately rated;
- (e)separate exposures to the same obligor shall be assigned to the same obligor grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. However, where separate exposures are allowed to result in multiple grades for the same obligor, the following shall apply:(i)country transfer risk, this being dependent on whether the exposures are denominated in local or foreign currency;(ii)the treatment of associated guarantees to an exposure may be reflected in an adjusted assignment to an obligor grade;(iii)consumer protection, bank secrecy or other legislation prohibit the exchange of client data.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), an institution shall have appropriate policies for the treatment of individual obligor clients and groups of connected clients. Those policies shall contain a process for the identification of Specific Wrong-Way risk for each legal entity to which the institution is exposed.For the purposes of Chapter 6, transactions with counterparties where a Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified shall be treated differently when calculating their exposure value.


**2.** For retail exposures, each exposure shall be assigned to a grade or a pool as part of the credit approval process.


**3.** For grade and pool assignments institutions shall document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides. Institutions shall document these overrides and note down the personnel responsible. Institutions shall analyse the performance of the exposures whose assignments have been overridden. This analysis shall include an assessment of the performance of exposures whose rating has been overridden by a particular person, accounting for all the responsible personnel.


# Article 173

**Integrity of assignment process**

*Article 173*


**1.** For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, the assignment process shall meet the following requirements:
- (a)Assignments and periodic reviews of assignments shall be completed or approved by an independent party that does not directly benefit from decisions to extend the credit;
- (b)Institutions shall review assignments at least annually and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. High risk obligors and problem exposures shall be subject to more frequent review. Institutions shall undertake a new assignment if material information on the obligor or exposure becomes available;
- (c)An institution shall have an effective process to obtain and update relevant information on obligor characteristics that affect PDs, and on transaction characteristics that affect LGDs or conversion factors.


**2.** For retail exposures, an institution shall at least annually review obligor and facility assignments and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment, or review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool, whichever applicable. An institution shall also at least annually review in a representative sample the status of individual exposures within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool, and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards setting out the methodologies of the competent authorities to assess the integrity of the assignment process and the regular and independent assessment of risks.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 174

**Use of models**

*Article 174*

Institutions shall use statistical or other mathematical methods ("models") to assign exposures to obligor or facility grades or pools. The following requirements shall be met:
- (a)the model shall have good predictive power and own funds requirements shall not be distorted as a result of its use;
- (b)the institution shall have in place a process for vetting data inputs into the model, which includes an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data;
- (c)the data used to build the model shall be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or exposures;
- (d)the institution shall have a regular cycle of model validation that includes monitoring of model performance and stability; review of model specification; and testing of model outputs against outcomes;
- (e)the institution shall complement the statistical model by human judgement and human oversight to review model-based assignments and to ensure that the models are used appropriately. Review procedures shall aim at finding and limiting errors associated with model weaknesses. Human judgements shall take into account all relevant information not considered by the model. The institution shall document how human judgement and model results are to be combined.For the purposes of the first paragraph, point (a), the input variables shall form a reasonable and effective basis for the resulting predictions. The model shall not have material biases. There shall be a functional link between the inputs and the outputs of the model, which may be determined through expert judgement, where appropriate.
# Article 175

**Documentation of rating systems**

*Article 175*


**1.** The institutions shall document the design and operational details of its rating systems. The documentation shall provide evidence of compliance with the requirements in this Section, and address topics including portfolio differentiation, rating criteria, responsibilities of parties that rate obligors and exposures, frequency of assignment reviews, and management oversight of the rating process.


**2.** The institution shall document the rationale for and analysis supporting its choice of rating criteria. An institution shall document all major changes in the risk rating process, and such documentation shall support identification of changes made to the risk rating process subsequent to the last review by the competent authorities. The organisation of rating assignment including the rating assignment process and the internal control structure shall also be documented.


**3.** The institutions shall document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure consistency with the definitions set out in this Regulation.


**4.** Where the institution employs statistical models in the rating process, the institution shall document their methodologies. This material shall:
- (a)provide a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions and mathematical and empirical basis of the assignment of estimates to grades, individual obligors, exposures, or pools, and the data source(s) used to estimate the model;
- (b)establish a rigorous statistical process including out-of-time and out-of-sample performance tests for validating the model;
- (c)indicate any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively.


**5.** An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the requirements of this Article are met, where an institution has obtained a rating system, or model used within a rating system, from a third-party vendor and that vendor refuses or restricts the access of the institution to information pertaining to the methodology of that rating system or model, or underlying data used to develop that methodology or model, on the basis that such information is proprietary.


# Article 176

**Data maintenance**

*Article 176*


**1.** Institutions shall collect and store data on aspects of their internal ratings as required under Part Eight.


**2.** For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, institutions shall collect and store:
- (a)complete rating histories on obligors and recognised guarantors;
- (b)the dates the ratings were assigned;
- (c)the key data and methodology used to derive the rating;
- (d)the person responsible for the rating assignment;
- (e)the identity of obligors and exposures that defaulted;
- (f)the date and circumstances of such defaults;
- (g)data on the PDs and realised default rates associated with rating grades and ratings migration.


**3.** For exposures for which this Chapter allows the use of own estimates of LGD or the use of IRB-CCF but for which institutions do not use own estimates of LGD or IRB-CCF, institutions shall collect and store data on comparisons between realised LGDs and the values as set out in Article 161(1), and between realised CCFs and SA-CCFs as set out in Article 166(8a).


**4.** Institutions using own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall collect and store:
- (a)complete histories of data on the facility ratings and LGD and conversion factor estimates associated with each rating scale;
- (b)the dates on which the ratings were assigned and the estimates were made;
- (c)the key data and methodology used to derive the facility ratings and LGD and conversion factor estimates;
- (d)the person who assigned the facility rating and the person who provided LGD and conversion factor estimates;
- (e)data on the estimated and realised LGDs and conversion factors associated with each defaulted exposure;
- (f)data on the LGD of the exposure before and after evaluation of the effects of a guarantee/or credit derivative, for those institutions that reflect the credit risk mitigating effects of guarantees or credit derivatives through LGD;
- (g)data on the components of loss for each defaulted exposure.


**5.** For retail exposures, institutions shall collect and store:
- (a)data used in the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools;
- (b)data on the estimated PDs, LGDs and conversion factors associated with grades or pools of exposures;
- (c)the identity of obligors and exposures that defaulted;
- (d)for defaulted exposures, data on the grades or pools to which the exposure was assigned over the year prior to default and the realised outcomes on LGD and conversion factor;
- (e)data on loss rates for qualifying revolving retail exposures.


# Article 177

**Stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy**

*Article 177*


**1.** An institution shall have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the assessment of its capital adequacy. Stress testing shall involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on an institution's credit exposures and assessment of the institution's ability to withstand such changes.


**2.** An institution shall regularly perform a credit risk stress test to assess the effect of certain specific conditions on its total capital requirements for credit risk. The test shall be one chosen by the institution, subject to supervisory review. The test to be employed shall be meaningful and consider the effects of severe, but plausible, recession scenarios. An institution shall assess migration in its ratings under the stress test scenarios. Stressed portfolios shall contain the vast majority of an institution's total exposure.


**2a.** The scenarios used under paragraph 2 shall also include ESG risk drivers, in particular physical risk and transition risk drivers stemming from climate change.EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on the application of paragraph 2 and 2a.


**3.** Institutions using the treatment set out in Article 153(3) shall consider as part of their stress testing framework the impact of a deterioration in the credit quality of protection providers, in particular the impact of protection providers falling outside the eligibility criteria.


# Article 178

**Default of an obligor or credit facility**

*Article 178*


**1.** A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the following have taken place:
- (a)the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security;
- (b)the obligor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower.


**2.** The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:
- (a)for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying amount is material;
- (b)for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution;
- (c)days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date;
- (d)materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers to be reasonable;
- (e)institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution.


**3.** For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay shall include the following:
- (a)the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status;
- (b)the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure;
- (c)the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss;
- (d)the institution consents to a forbearance measure as referred to in Article 47b of the credit obligation where that measure is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation due to the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or, where relevant, fees;
- (e)the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;
- (f)the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.


**4.** Institutions that use external data that is not itself consistent with the definition of default laid down in paragraph 1, shall make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default.


**5.** If the institution considers that a previously defaulted exposure is such that no trigger of default continues to apply, the institution shall rate the obligor or facility as they would for a non-defaulted exposure. Where the definition of default is subsequently triggered, another default would be deemed to have occurred.


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which a competent authority shall set the threshold referred to in paragraph 2(d).EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**7.** EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of this Article. Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.By 10 July 2025, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to update the guidelines referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. In particular, that update shall take due account of the necessity to encourage institutions to engage in proactive, preventive and meaningful debt restructuring to support obligors.In developing those guidelines, EBA shall duly consider the need for granting a sufficient flexibility to institutions when specifying what constitutes a diminished financial obligation for the purposes of paragraph 3, point (d).


# Article 179

**Overall requirements for estimation**

*Article 179*


**1.** In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements:
- (a)an institution's own estimates of the risk parameters PD, LGD, conversion factor and EL shall incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation;
- (b)an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters. The institution's estimates shall be representative of long run experience;
- (c)any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation periods referred to in Article 180(1)(h) and (2)(e), Article 181(1)(j) and (2), and Article 182(2) and (3) shall be taken into account. An institution's estimates shall reflect the implications of technical advances and new data and other information, as it becomes available. Institutions shall review their estimates when new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis;
- (d)the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data was generated and other relevant characteristics shall be comparable with those of the institution's exposures and standards. The economic or market conditions that underlie the data shall be relevant to current and foreseeable conditions. The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification shall be sufficient to provide the institution with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates;
- (e)for purchased receivables the estimates shall reflect all relevant information available to the purchasing institution regarding the quality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the purchasing institution, or by external sources. The purchasing institution shall evaluate any data relied upon which is provided by the seller;
- (f)to overcome biases, an institution shall include appropriate adjustments in its estimates to the extent possible; after having included an appropriate adjustment, it shall add to its estimates a sufficient margin of conservatism that is related to the expected range of estimation errors; where methods and data are considered to be less satisfactory, the expected range of errors is larger, and the margin of conservatism shall be larger.Where institutions use different estimates for the calculation of risk weights and for internal purposes, it shall be documented and be reasonable. If institutions can demonstrate to their competent authorities that for data that have been collected prior to 1 January 2007 appropriate adjustments have been made to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default laid down in Article 178 or with loss, competent authorities may permit the institutions some flexibility in the application of the required standards for data.


**2.** Where an institution uses data that is pooled across institutions it shall meet the following requirements:
- (a)the rating systems and criteria of other institutions in the pool are similar to its own;
- (b)the pool is representative of the portfolio for which the pooled data is used;
- (c)the pooled data is used consistently over time by the institution for its estimates;
- (d)the institution shall remain responsible for the integrity of its rating systems;
- (e)the institution shall maintain sufficient in-house understanding of its rating systems, including the ability to effectively monitor and audit the rating process.


# Article 180

**Requirements specific to PD estimation**

*Article 180*


**1.** In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to PD estimation to exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates:
- (a)institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year default rates. PD estimates for obligors that are highly leveraged or for obligors whose assets are predominantly traded assets shall reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities;
- (b)for purchased corporate receivables institutions may estimate the EL by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year realised default rates;
- (c)if an institution derives long run average estimates of PDs and LGDs for purchased corporate receivables from an estimate of EL, and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in Article 181(1)(a);
- (d)institutions shall use PD estimation techniques only with supporting analysis. Institutions shall recognise the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information;
- (e)to the extent that an institution uses data on internal default experience for the estimation of PDs, the estimates shall be reflective of current underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system; where underwriting standards or rating systems have changed, after including an appropriate adjustment, the institution shall add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of PD related to the expected range of estimation errors that is not already covered by the appropriate adjustment;
- (f)to the extent that an institution associates or maps its internal grades to the scale used by an ECAI or similar organisations and then attributes the default rate observed for the external organisation's grades to the institution's grades, mappings shall be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data shall be avoided. The criteria of the external organisation underlying the data used for quantification shall be oriented to default risk only and not reflect transaction characteristics. The analysis undertaken by the institution shall include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in Article 178. The institution shall document the basis for the mapping;
- (g)to the extent that an institution uses statistical default prediction models it is allowed to estimate PDs as the simple average of default-probability estimates for individual obligors in a given grade. The institution's use of default probability models for this purpose shall meet the standards specified in Article 174;
- (h)irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source;
- (i)irrespective of the method used to estimate PD, institutions shall estimate a PD for each rating grade based on the observed historical average one-year default rate that is an arithmetic average based on the number of obligors (count weighted); other approaches, including exposure-weighted averages, shall not be permitted.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (h), of this paragraph where the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and where those data are relevant, that longer period shall be used. The data shall include a representative mix of good and bad years of the economic cycle relevant for the type of exposures. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions which have not received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own estimates of LGD or to use IRB-CCF, may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall be increased by one year each year until relevant data cover at least five years.


**2.** For retail exposures, the following requirements shall apply:
- (a)institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor or facility grade or pool from long run averages of one-year default rates, and default rates shall be calculated at facility level only where the definition of default is applied at individual credit facility level pursuant to Article 178(1), second subparagraph;
- (b)PD estimates may also be derived from an estimate of total losses and appropriate estimates of LGDs;
- (c)institutions shall regard internal data for assigning exposures to grades or pools as the primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics. Institutions may use external data (including pooled data) or statistical models for quantification provided that the following strong links both exist:(i)between the institution's process of assigning exposures to grades or pools and the process used by the external data source; and(ii)between the institution's internal risk profile and the composition of the external data;
- (d)if an institution derives long run average estimates of PD and LGD for retail exposures from an estimate of total losses and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in point (a) of Article 181(1);
- (e)irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source;
- (f)institutions shall identify and analyse expected changes of risk parameters over the life of credit exposures (seasoning effects).For purchased retail receivables, institutions may use external and internal reference data. Institutions shall use all relevant data sources as points of comparison.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), the PD shall be based on the observed historical average one-year default rate.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (e), where the available observation spans a longer period for any source, and where those data are relevant, that longer period shall be used. The data shall include a representative mix of good and bad years of the economic cycle relevant for the type of exposures. Subject to the permission of the competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall be increased by one year each year until relevant data cover at least five years.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the methodologies in accordance with which competent authorities shall assess the methodology of an institution for estimating PD pursuant to Article 143.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 181

**Requirements specific to own-LGD estimates**

*Article 181*


**1.** In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-LGD estimates:
- (a)institutions shall estimate LGDs by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised LGDs by facility grade or pool using all observed defaults within the data sources (default weighted average);
- (b)institutions shall use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn;
- (c)an institution shall consider the extent of any dependence between, on the one hand, the risk of the obligor and, on the other hand, that of funded credit protection, other than master netting agreements and on-balance-sheet netting of loans and deposits, or its provider;
- (d)currency mismatches between the underlying obligation and the funded credit protection other than master netting agreements and on-balance-sheet netting of loans and deposits shall be treated conservatively in the institution’s assessment of LGD;
- (e)to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of funded credit protection other than master netting agreements and on-balance-sheet netting of loans and deposits, those estimates shall not solely be based on the estimated market value of the funded credit protection;
- (f)to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of funded credit protection other than master netting agreements and on-balance-sheet netting of loans and deposits, institutions shall establish internal requirements for the management, legal certainty and risk management of that funded credit protection, and those requirements shall be generally consistent with those set out in Chapter 4, Section 3, Sub-section 1;
- (g)to the extent that an institution recognises funded credit protection other than master netting agreements and on-balance-sheet netting of loans and deposits for determining the exposure value for counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 5 or 6, any amount expected to be recovered from that funded credit protection shall not be taken into account in the LGD estimates;
- (h)for the specific case of exposures already in default, the institution shall use the sum of its best estimate of expected loss for each exposure given current economic circumstances and exposure status and its estimate of the increase of loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period, i.e. between date of default and final liquidation of the exposure;
- (i)to the extent that fees for late payments, imposed on the obligor before the time of default, have been capitalised in the institution’s income statement, they shall be added to the institution's measure of exposure and loss;
- (j)for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, and regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, estimates of LGD shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source, if the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data are relevant, that longer period shall be used.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), of this paragraph institutions shall adequately take into account recoveries realised in the course of the relevant recovery processes from any type of funded credit protection as well as from unfunded credit protection not falling under the definition in Article 142(1), point (10).For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), cases where there is a significant degree of dependence shall be addressed in a conservative manner.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (e), LGD estimates shall take into account the effect of the potential inability of institutions to expeditiously gain control of their collateral and liquidate it.


**2.** For retail exposures, institutions may do the following:
- (a)derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PDs;
- (b)reflect future drawings either in their conversion factors or in their LGD estimates;
- (c)For purchased retail receivables use external and internal reference data to estimate LGDs.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (b), where institutions include future additional drawings in their conversion factors, those should be taken into account in the LGD in both the numerator and the denominator. Where institutions do not include future additional drawings in their conversion factors, those should be taken into account in the LGD numerator only.For retail exposures, estimates of LGD shall be based on data over a minimum of five years. Subject to the permission of the competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall be increased by one year each year until relevant data cover at least five years.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn referred to in paragraph 1;
- (b)the conditions according to which a competent authority may permit an institution pursuant to paragraph 2 to use relevant data covering a period of two years when the institution implements the IRB Approach.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**4.** EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to clarify the treatment of any type of funded credit protection and unfunded credit protection for the purposes of paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article and for the purposes of the application of the LGD parameters.


**5.** For the purpose of calculating loss, EBA shall, by 31 December 2025, issue updated guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on the following:
- (a)with regard to cases that return to non-defaulted status, specifying how artificial cash flow is to be treated and whether it is more appropriate for institutions to discount the artificial cash flow over the actual period of default;
- (b)assessing whether the calibration and application of the discount rate is appropriate for the calculation of economic loss across all exposures.


# Article 182

**Requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates**

*Article 182*


**1.** In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to own-conversion factor estimates:
- (a)institutions shall estimate conversion factors by facility grade or pool on the basis of the average realised conversion factors by facility grade or pool using the default weighted average resulting from all observed defaults within the data sources;
- (b)institutions shall use conversion factor estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised conversion factors at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn;
- (c)institutions’ IRB-CCF shall reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the obligor up to and after the time a default event is triggered;
- (d)in arriving at estimates of conversion factors institutions shall consider their specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. Institutions shall also consider their ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events;
- (e)institutions shall have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts, current outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per obligor and per grade. The institution shall be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis;
- (f)if institutions use different estimates of conversion factors for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and internal purposes it shall be documented and be reasonable;
- (g)institutions’ IRB-CCF shall be estimated using a 12-month fixed-horizon approach;
- (h)institutions’ IRB-CCF shall be based on reference data that reflect the obligor, facility and bank management practice characteristics of the exposures to which the estimates are applied.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), where institutions observe a negative realised conversion factor on their default observations, the realised conversion factor on those observations shall be equal to zero for the purpose of quantification of their IRB-CCF. Institutions may use the information of the negative realised conversion factor in the process of model development for the purpose of risk differentiation.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), IRB-CCF shall incorporate a greater margin of conservatism where a stronger positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of the conversion factor.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (g), each default shall be linked to relevant obligor and facility characteristics at the fixed reference date defined as 12 months prior to the date of default.


**1a.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (h), IRB-CCF applied to particular exposures shall not be based on data that comingle the effects of disparate characteristics or data from exposures that exhibit materially different risk characteristics. IRB-CCF shall be based on appropriately homogenous segments. For that purpose, the following practices shall only be allowed on the basis of a detailed scrutiny and justification by an institution:
- (a)SME/mid-market underlying data being applied to large corporate obligors;
- (b)data from commitments with a small unused limit availability being applied to facilities with a large unused limit availability;
- (c)data from delinquent obligors or blocked for further drawdowns at the reference date being applied to obligors with no known delinquency or relevant restrictions;
- (d)data that have been affected by changes in the obligors’ mix of borrowing and other credit-related products over the observation period unless those data have been effectively adjusted by removing the effects of the changes in the product mix.


**1b.** For the purposes of paragraph 1a, point (d), institutions shall demonstrate to the competent authorities that they have a detailed understanding of the impact of changes in customer product mix on the exposures reference data sets and associated IRB-CCF, and that the impact is immaterial or has been effectively mitigated within their estimation process. In that regard, the following shall not be deemed appropriate:
- (a)setting floors or caps to CCF or exposure value observations, with the exception of the realised conversion factor equal to zero, in accordance with paragraph 1, second subparagraph;
- (b)using obligor-level estimates that do not fully cover the relevant product transformation options or that inappropriately combine products with very different characteristics;
- (c)adjusting only material observations affected by product transformation;
- (d)excluding observations affected by product profile transformation.


**1c.** Institutions shall ensure that their IRB-CCF are effectively quarantined from the potential effects of region of instability caused by a facility being close to being fully drawn at the reference date.


**1d.** Reference data shall not be capped at the principal amount outstanding of a facility or the available facility limit. Accrued interest, other due payments and drawings in excess of facility limits shall be included in the reference data.


**2.** For exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, and regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years, increasing by one year each year after implementation until a minimum of seven years is reached, for at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data are relevant, that longer period shall be used.


**3.** For retail exposures, institutions may reflect future drawings either in their conversion factors or in their LGD estimates.For retail exposures, estimates of conversion factors shall be based on data over a minimum of five years. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years. The period to be covered shall be increased by one year each year until relevant data cover at least five years.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn referred to in paragraph 1;
- (b)conditions according to which a competent authority may permit and institution to use relevant data covering a period of two years at the time an institution first implements the IRB Approach.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**5.** By 31 December 2026, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to specify the methodology that institutions are to apply in order to estimate IRB-CCF.


# Article 183

**Requirements for assessing the effect of unfunded credit protection for exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, and exposures to corporates, where own estimates of LGD are used and for retail exposures**

*Article 183*


**1.** The following requirements shall apply in relation to eligible guarantors and guarantees:
- (a)institutions shall have clearly specified criteria for the types of guarantors they recognise for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts;
- (b)for recognised guarantors the same rules as for obligors as set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173 shall apply;
- (c)the guarantee shall be evidenced in writing, non-cancellable and non-changeable on the part of the guarantor, in force until the obligation is satisfied in full, to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee, and legally enforceable against the guarantor in a jurisdiction where the guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a judgement;
- (d)the guarantee shall be unconditional.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), an "unconditional guarantee" means a guarantee where the credit protection contract does not contain any clause the fulfilment of which is outside the direct control of the lending institution and that could prevent the guarantor from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner pursuant to the qualifying default of the obligor or to the non-payment by the original obligor. A clause in the credit protection contract providing that a flawed due diligence or fraud by the lending institution cancels or diminishes the extent of the guarantee offered by the guarantor shall not disqualify that guarantee from being considered unconditional.Guarantees where the payment by the guarantor is subject to the lending institution first having to pursue the obligor and that only cover losses remaining after the institution has completed the workout process shall be considered unconditional.


**1a.** Institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection by using either the PD/LGD modelling adjustment approach, in accordance with this Article and subject to the requirement set out in paragraph 4 of this Article, or the substitution of risk parameters approach under A-IRB in accordance with Article 236a and subject to the eligibility requirements of Chapter 4. Institutions shall have clear policies for assessing the effects of unfunded credit protection on risk parameters. The policies of the institutions shall be consistent with their internal risk management practices and shall reflect the requirements of this Article. Those policies shall clearly specify which of the specific methods described in this paragraph are used for each rating system, and institutions shall apply those policies consistently over time.


**2.** An institution shall have clearly specified criteria for adjusting grades, pools or LGD estimates, and, in the case of retail and eligible purchased receivables, the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools, to reflect the impact of guarantees for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts. These criteria shall comply with the requirements set out in Articles 171, 172 and 173.The criteria shall be plausible and intuitive. They shall address the guarantor's ability and willingness to perform under the guarantee, the likely timing of any payments from the guarantor, the degree to which the guarantor's ability to perform under the guarantee is correlated with the obligor's ability to repay, and the extent to which residual risk to the obligor remains.


**3.** The requirements for guarantees in this Article shall apply also for single-name credit derivatives. In relation to a mismatch between the underlying obligation and the reference obligation of the credit derivative or the obligation used for determining whether a credit event has occurred, the requirements set out under Article 216(2) shall apply. For retail exposures and eligible purchased receivables, this paragraph applies to the process of allocating exposures to grades or pools.The criteria shall address the payout structure of the credit derivative and conservatively assess the impact this has on the level and timing of recoveries. The institution shall consider the extent to which other forms of residual risk remain.First-to-default credit derivatives may be recognised as eligible unfunded credit protection. However, second-to-default and all other nth-to-default credit derivatives shall not be recognised as eligible unfunded credit protection.


**4.** Where institutions recognise unfunded credit protection by the PD/LGD modelling adjustment approach, the covered part of the underlying exposure shall not be assigned a risk weight which would be lower than the protection-provider-RW-floor. For that purpose, the protection-provider-RW-floor shall be calculated using the same PD, LGD and risk weight function as the ones applicable to comparable direct exposure to the protection provider as referred to in Article 236a.


**5.** For retail guarantees, the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to the assignment of exposures to grades or pools, and the estimation of PD.


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which competent authorities may permit conditional guarantees to be recognised.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 184

**Requirements for purchased receivables**

*Article 184*


**1.** In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools for purchased receivables, institutions shall ensure the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 6 are met.


**2.** The structure of the facility shall ensure that under all foreseeable circumstances the institution has effective ownership and control of all cash remittances from the receivables. When the obligor makes payments directly to a seller or servicer, the institution shall verify regularly that payments are forwarded completely and within the contractually agreed terms. Institutions shall have procedures to ensure that ownership over the receivables and cash receipts is protected against bankruptcy stays or legal challenges that could materially delay the lender's ability to liquidate or assign the receivables or retain control over cash receipts.


**3.** The institution shall monitor both the quality of the purchased receivables and the financial condition of the seller and servicer. The following shall apply:
- (a)the institution shall assess the correlation among the quality of the purchased receivables and the financial condition of both the seller and servicer, and have in place internal policies and procedures that provide adequate safeguards to protect against any contingencies, including the assignment of an internal risk rating for each seller and servicer;
- (b)the institution shall have clear and effective policies and procedures for determining seller and servicer eligibility. The institution or its agent shall conduct periodic reviews of sellers and servicers in order to verify the accuracy of reports from the seller or servicer, detect fraud or operational weaknesses, and verify the quality of the seller's credit policies and servicer's collection policies and procedures. The findings of these reviews shall be documented;
- (c)the institution shall assess the characteristics of the purchased receivables pools, including over-advances; history of the seller's arrears, bad debts, and bad debt allowances; payment terms, and potential contra accounts;
- (d)the institution shall have effective policies and procedures for monitoring on an aggregate basis single-obligor concentrations both within and across purchased receivables pools;
- (e)the institution shall ensure that it receives from the servicer timely and sufficiently detailed reports of receivables ageings and dilutions to ensure compliance with the institution's eligibility criteria and advancing policies governing purchased receivables, and provide an effective means with which to monitor and confirm the seller's terms of sale and dilution.


**4.** The institution shall have systems and procedures for detecting deteriorations in the seller's financial condition and purchased receivables quality at an early stage, and for addressing emerging problems pro-actively. In particular, the institution shall have clear and effective policies, procedures, and information systems to monitor covenant violations, and clear and effective policies and procedures for initiating legal actions and dealing with problem purchased receivables.


**5.** The institution shall have clear and effective policies and procedures governing the control of purchased receivables, credit, and cash. In particular, written internal policies shall specify all material elements of the receivables purchase programme, including the advancing rates, eligible collateral, necessary documentation, concentration limits, and the way cash receipts are to be handled. These elements shall take appropriate account of all relevant and material factors, including the seller and servicer's financial condition, risk concentrations, and trends in the quality of the purchased receivables and the seller's customer base, and internal systems shall ensure that funds are advanced only against specified supporting collateral and documentation.


**6.** The institution shall have an effective internal process for assessing compliance with all internal policies and procedures. The process shall include regular audits of all critical phases of the institution's receivables purchase programme, verification of the separation of duties between firstly the assessment of the seller and servicer and the assessment of the obligor and secondly between the assessment of the seller and servicer and the field audit of the seller and servicer, and evaluations of back office operations, with particular focus on qualifications, experience, staffing levels, and supporting automation systems.


# Article 185

**Validation of internal estimates**

*Article 185*

Institutions shall validate their internal estimates subject to the following requirements:
- (a)institutions shall have robust systems in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of rating systems, processes, and the estimation of all relevant risk parameters. The internal validation process shall enable the institution to assess the performance of internal rating and risk estimation systems consistently and meaningfully;
- (b)institutions shall regularly compare realised default rates with estimated PDs for each grade and, where realised default rates are outside the expected range for that grade, institutions shall specifically analyse the reasons for the deviation. Institutions using own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall also perform analogous analysis for these estimates. Such comparisons shall make use of historical data that cover as long a period as possible. The institution shall document the methods and data used in such comparisons. This analysis and documentation shall be updated at least annually;
- (c)institutions shall also use other quantitative validation tools and comparisons with relevant external data sources. The analysis shall be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, are updated regularly, and cover a relevant observation period. Institutions' internal assessments of the performance of their rating systems shall be based on as long a period as possible;
- (d)the methods and data used for quantitative validation shall be consistent through time. Changes in estimation and validation methods and data (both data sources and periods covered) shall be documented;
- (e)institutions shall have sound internal standards for situations where deviations in realised PDs, LGDs, conversion factors and total losses, where EL is used, from expectations, become significant enough to call the validity of the estimates into question. These standards shall take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default experience. Where realised values continue to be higher than expected values, institutions shall revise estimates upward to reflect their default and loss experience;
# Article 186

**Own funds requirement and risk quantification**

*Article 186*

For the purpose of calculating own funds requirements institutions shall meet the following standards:
- (a)the estimate of potential loss shall be robust to adverse market movements relevant to the long-term risk profile of the institution's specific holdings. The data used to represent return distributions shall reflect the longest sample period for which data is available and meaningful in representing the risk profile of the institution's specific equity exposures. The data used shall be sufficient to provide conservative, statistically reliable and robust loss estimates that are not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations. The shock employed shall provide a conservative estimate of potential losses over a relevant long-term market or business cycle. The institution shall combine empirical analysis of available data with adjustments based on a variety of factors in order to attain model outputs that achieve appropriate realism and conservatism. In constructing value at risk (VaR) models estimating potential quarterly losses, institutions may use quarterly data or convert shorter horizon period data to a quarterly equivalent using an analytically appropriate method supported by empirical evidence and through a well-developed and documented thought process and analysis. Such an approach shall be applied conservatively and consistently over time. Where only limited relevant data is available the institution shall add appropriate margins of conservatism;
- (b)the models used shall capture adequately all of the material risks embodied in equity returns including both the general market risk and specific risk exposure of the institution's equity portfolio. The internal models shall adequately explain historical price variation, capture both the magnitude and changes in the composition of potential concentrations, and be robust to adverse market environments. The population of risk exposures represented in the data used for estimation shall be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the institution's equity exposures;
- (c)the internal model shall be appropriate for the risk profile and complexity of an institution's equity portfolio. Where an institution has material holdings with values that are highly non-linear in nature the internal models shall be designed to capture appropriately the risks associated with such instruments;
- (d)mapping of individual positions to proxies, market indices, and risk factors shall be plausible, intuitive, and conceptually sound;
- (e)institutions shall demonstrate through empirical analyses the appropriateness of risk factors, including their ability to cover both general and specific risk;
- (f)the estimates of the return volatility of equity exposures shall incorporate relevant and available data, information, and methods. Independently reviewed internal data or data from external sources including pooled data shall be used;
- (g)a rigorous and comprehensive stress-testing programme shall be in place.
# Article 187

**Risk management process and controls**

*Article 187*

With regard to the development and use of internal models for own funds requirement purposes, institutions shall establish policies, procedures, and controls to ensure the integrity of the model and modelling process. These policies, procedures, and controls shall include the following:
- (a)full integration of the internal model into the overall management information systems of the institution and in the management of the non-trading book equity portfolio. Internal models shall be fully integrated into the institution's risk management infrastructure if they are particularly used in measuring and assessing equity portfolio performance including the risk-adjusted performance, allocating economic capital to equity exposures and evaluating overall capital adequacy and the investment management process;
- (b)established management systems, procedures, and control functions for ensuring the periodic and independent review of all elements of the internal modelling process, including approval of model revisions, vetting of model inputs, and review of model results, such as direct verification of risk computations. These reviews shall assess the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of model inputs and results and focus on both finding and limiting potential errors associated with known weaknesses and identifying unknown model weaknesses. Such reviews may be conducted by an internal independent unit, or by an independent external third party;
- (c)adequate systems and procedures for monitoring investment limits and the risk exposures of equity exposures;
- (d)the units responsible for the design and application of the model shall be functionally independent from the units responsible for managing individual investments;
- (e)parties responsible for any aspect of the modelling process shall be adequately qualified. Management shall allocate sufficient skilled and competent resources to the modelling function.
# Article 188

**Validation and documentation**

*Article 188*

Institutions shall have robust systems in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of their internal models and modelling processes. All material elements of the internal models and the modelling process and validation shall be documented.The validation and documentation of institutions' internal models and modelling processes shall be subject to the following requirements:
- (a)institutions shall use the internal validation process to assess the performance of its internal models and processes in a consistent and meaningful way;
- (b)the methods and data used for quantitative validation shall be consistent over time. Changes in estimation and validation methods and changes to data sources and periods covered, shall be documented;
- (c)institutions shall regularly compare actual equity returns computed using realised and unrealised gains and losses with modelled estimates. Such comparisons shall make use of historical data that cover as long a period as possible. The institution shall document the methods and data used in such comparisons. This analysis and documentation shall be updated at least annually;
- (d)institutions shall make use of other quantitative validation tools and comparisons with external data sources. The analysis shall be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, are updated regularly, and cover a relevant observation period. Institutions' internal assessments of the performance of their models shall be based on as long a period as possible;
- (e)institutions shall have sound internal standards for addressing situations where comparison of actual equity returns with the models estimates calls the validity of the estimates or of the models as such into question. These standards shall take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in equity returns. All adjustments made to internal models in response to model reviews shall be documented and consistent with the institution's model review standards;
- (f)the internal model and the modelling process shall be documented, including the responsibilities of parties involved in the modelling, and the model approval and model review processes.
# Article 189

**Corporate Governance**

*Article 189*


**1.** All material aspects of the rating and estimation processes shall be approved by the institution's management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management. These parties shall possess a general understanding of the rating systems of the institution and detailed comprehension of its associated management reports.


**2.** Senior management shall be subject to the following requirements:
- (a)they shall provide notice to the management body or a designated committee thereof of material changes or exceptions from established policies that will materially impact the operations of the institution's rating systems;

# Article 193

**Principles for recognising the effect of credit risk mitigation techniques**

*Article 193*


**1.** No exposure in respect of which an institution obtains credit risk mitigation shall produce a higher risk-weighted exposure amount or expected loss amount than an otherwise identical exposure in respect of which an institution has no credit risk mitigation.


**2.** Where the risk-weighted exposure amount already takes account of credit protection under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, as applicable, institutions shall not take into account that credit protection in the calculations under this Chapter.


**3.** Where the provisions in Sections 2 and 3 are met, institutions may amend the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach and the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4, 5 and 6.


**4.** Institutions shall treat cash, securities or commodities purchased, borrowed or received under a repurchase transaction or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transaction as collateral.


**5.** Where an institution calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach has more than one form of credit risk mitigation covering a single exposure it shall do both of the following:
- (a)subdivide the exposure into parts covered by each type of credit risk mitigation tool;
- (b)calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for each part obtained in point (a) separately in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2 and this Chapter.


**6.** When an institution calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach covers a single exposure with credit protection provided by a single protection provider and that protection has differing maturities, it shall do both of the following:
- (a)subdivide the exposure into parts covered by each credit risk mitigation tool;
- (b)calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for each part obtained in point (a) separately in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2 and this Chapter.


**7.** Collateral that satisfies all eligibility requirements set out in this Chapter can be recognised even for exposures associated with undrawn facilities, where drawing under the facility is conditional on the prior or simultaneous purchase or reception of collateral to the extent of the institution’s interest in the collateral once the facility is drawn, such that the institution does not have any interest in the collateral to the extent the facility is not drawn.


# Article 194

**Principles governing the eligibility of credit risk mitigation techniques**

*Article 194*


**1.** The technique used to provide the credit protection together with the actions and steps taken and procedures and policies implemented by the lending institution shall be such as to result in credit protection arrangements which are legally effective and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions.The lending institution shall provide, upon request of the competent authority, the most recent version of the independent, written and reasoned legal opinion or opinions that it used to establish whether its credit protection arrangement or arrangements meet the condition laid down in the first subparagraph.


**2.** The lending institution shall take all appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of the credit protection arrangement and to address the risks related to that arrangement.


**3.** Institutions may recognise funded credit protection in the calculation of the effect of credit risk mitigation only where the assets relied upon for protection meet both of the following conditions:
- (a)they are included in the list of eligible assets set out in Articles 197 to 200, as applicable;
- (b)they are sufficiently liquid and their value over time sufficiently stable to provide appropriate certainty as to the credit protection achieved having regard to the approach used to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and to the degree of recognition allowed.


**4.** Institutions may recognise funded credit protection in the calculation of the effect of credit risk mitigation only where the lending institution has the right to liquidate or retain, in a timely manner, the assets from which the protection derives in the event of the default, insolvency or bankruptcy — or other credit event set out in the transaction documentation — of the obligor and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral. The degree of correlation between the value of the assets relied upon for protection and the credit quality of the obligor shall not be too high.


**5.** In the case of unfunded credit protection, a protection provider shall qualify as an eligible protection provider only where the protection provider is included in the list of eligible protection providers set out in Article 201 or 202, as applicable.


**6.** In the case of unfunded credit protection, a protection agreement shall qualify as an eligible protection agreement only where it meets both the following conditions:
- (a)it is included in the list of eligible protection agreements set out in Articles 203 and 204(1);
- (b)it is legally effective and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions, to provide appropriate certainty as to the credit protection achieved having regard to the approach used to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and to the degree of recognition allowed;
- (c)the protection provider meets the criteria laid down in paragraph 5.


**7.** Credit protection shall comply with the requirements set out in Section 3, as applicable.


**8.** An institution shall be able to demonstrate to competent authorities that it has adequate risk management processes to control those risks to which it may be exposed as a result of carrying out credit risk mitigation practices.


**9.** Notwithstanding the fact that credit risk mitigation has been taken into account for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and, where applicable, expected loss amounts, institutions shall continue to undertake a full credit risk assessment of the underlying exposure and be in a position to demonstrate the fulfilment of this requirement to the competent authorities. In the case of repurchase transactions and securities lending or commodities lending or borrowing transactions the underlying exposure shall, for the purposes of this paragraph only, be deemed to be the net amount of the exposure.


**10.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what constitutes sufficiently liquid assets and when asset values can be considered as sufficiently stable for the purpose of paragraph 3.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 September 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 195

**On-balance sheet netting**

*Article 195*

An institution may use on-balance sheet netting of mutual claims between itself and its counterparty as an eligible form of credit risk mitigation.Without prejudice to Article 196, eligibility is limited to reciprocal cash balances between the institution and the counterparty. Institutions may amend risk-weighted exposure amounts and, as relevant, expected loss amounts only for loans and deposits that they have received themselves and that are subject to an on-balance sheet netting agreement.
# Article 196

**Master netting agreements covering repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions**

*Article 196*

Institutions adopting the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method set out in Article 223 may take into account the effects of bilateral netting contracts covering repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, or other capital market-driven transactions with a counterparty. Without prejudice to Article 299, the collateral taken and securities or commodities borrowed within such agreements or transactions shall comply with the eligibility requirements for collateral set out in Articles 197 and 198.
# Article 197

- (d)debt securities, issued by other entities, which have a credit assessment by an ECAI where:(i)the ECAI has been nominated by the institution for the purposes of Chapter 2; and(ii)the credit assessment has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 1, 2 or 3 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates under Chapter 2;
- (e)debt securities having a short-term credit assessment by an ECAI where:(i)the ECAI has been nominated by the institution for the purposes of Chapter 2; and(ii)the credit assessment has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 1, 2 or 3 under the rules for the risk weighting of short-term exposures under Chapter 2;
- (f)equities or convertible bonds that are included in a main index;
- (g)gold bullion;
- (h)securitisation positions that are not resecuritisation positions and which are subject to a 100 % risk weight or lower in accordance with Article 261 to Article 264.


**2.** For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, "debt securities issued by central governments or central banks" shall include all the following:

**4.** An institution may use debt securities that are issued by other institutions or investment firms and that do not have a credit assessment by an ECAI as eligible collateral where those debt securities fulfil all the following criteria:
- (a)they are listed on a recognised exchange;
- (b)they qualify as senior debt;
- (c)all other rated issues by the issuing institution of the same seniority have a credit assessment by an ECAI which has been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions or short term exposures under Chapter 2;
- (d)the lending institution has no information to suggest that the issue would justify a credit assessment below that indicated in point (c);
- (e)the market liquidity of the instrument is sufficient for these purposes.


**5.** Institutions may use units or shares in CIUs as eligible collateral where all the following conditions are satisfied:
- (a)the units or shares have a daily public price quote;
- (b)the CIUs are limited to investing in instruments that are eligible for recognition under paragraphs 1 and 4;
- (c)the CIUs meet the conditions laid down in Article 132(3).Where a CIU invests in shares or units of another CIU, conditions laid down in points (a) to (c) of the first subparagraph shall apply equally to any such underlying CIU.The use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge permitted investments shall not prevent units or shares in that undertaking from being eligible as collateral.


**6.** For the purposes of paragraph 5 of this Article, where a CIU (the "original CIU") or any of its underlying CIUs are not limited to investing in instruments that are eligible under paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article, the following shall apply:
- (a)where the institutions apply the look-through approach referred to in Article 132a(1) or Article 152(2) for direct exposures to a CIU, they may use units or shares in that CIU as collateral up to the amount equal to the value of the instruments held by that CIU that are eligible under paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article;
- (b)where institutions apply the mandate-based approach referred to in Article 132a(2) or 152(5) for direct exposures to a CIU, they may use units or shares in that CIU as collateral up to the amount equal to the value of the instruments held by that CIU that are eligible under paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article under the assumption that that CIU or any of its underlying CIUs have invested in non-eligible instruments to the maximum extent allowed under their respective mandates.Where any underlying CIU has underlying CIUs of its own, institutions may use units or shares in the original CIU as eligible collateral provided that they apply the methodology laid down in the first subparagraph.Where non-eligible assets can have a negative value due to liabilities or contingent liabilities resulting from ownership, institutions shall do both of the following:
- (a)calculate the total value of the non-eligible assets;
- (b)where the amount obtained under point (a) is negative, subtract the absolute value of that amount from the total value of the eligible assets.


**7.** With regard to points (b) to (e) of paragraph 1, where a security has two credit assessments by ECAIs, institutions shall apply the less favourable assessment. Where a security has more than two credit assessments by ECAIs, institutions shall apply the two most favourable assessments. Where the two most favourable credit assessments are different, institutions shall apply the less favourable of the two.


**8.** ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)the main indices referred to in point (f) of paragraph 1 of this Article, in point (a) of Article 198(1), in Article 224(1) and (4), and in point (e) of Article 299(2);

# Article 198

**Additional eligibility of collateral under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method**

*Article 198*


**1.** In addition to the collateral established in Article 197, where an institution uses the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method set out in Article 223, that institution may use the following items as eligible collateral:
- (a)equities or convertible bonds not included in a main index but traded on a recognised exchange;
- (b)units or shares in CIUs where both the following conditions are met:(i)the units or shares have a daily public price quote;(ii)the CIU is limited to investing in instruments that are eligible for recognition under Article 197(1) and (4) and the items mentioned in point (a) of this subparagraph.In the case a CIU invests in units or shares of another CIU, conditions (a) and (b) of this paragraph equally apply to any such underlying CIU.The use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge permitted investments shall not prevent units or shares in that undertaking from being eligible as collateral.


**2.** Where the CIU or any underlying CIU are not limited to investing in instruments that are eligible for recognition under Article 197(1) and (4) and in the items referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article, the following shall apply:
- (a)where institutions apply the look-through approach referred to in Article 132a(1) or 152(2) for direct exposures to a CIU, they may use units or shares in that CIU as collateral up to the amount equal to the value of the instruments held by that CIU, that are eligible under Article 197(1) and (4), and the items referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article;
- (b)where institutions apply the mandate-based approach referred to in Article 132a(2) or 152(5) for direct exposures to a CIUs, they may use units or shares in that CIU as collateral up to the amount equal to the value of the instruments held by that CIU, that are eligible under Article 197(1) and (4), and the items referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article under the assumption that that CIU or any of its underlying CIUs have invested in non-eligible instruments to the maximum extent allowed under their respective mandates.Where non-eligible instruments can have a negative value due to liabilities or contingent liabilities resulting from ownership, institutions shall do both of the following:
- (a)calculate the total value of the non-eligible instruments;
- (b)where the amount obtained under point (a) is negative, subtract the absolute value of that amount from the total value of the eligible instruments.


# Article 199

**Additional eligibility for collateral under the IRB Approach**

*Article 199*


**1.** In addition to the collateral referred to in Articles 197 and 198, institutions that calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach may also use the following forms of collateral:
- (a)immovable property collateral in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4;
- (b)receivables in accordance with paragraph 5;
- (c)other physical collateral in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 8;
- (d)leasing in accordance with paragraph 7.


**2.** Unless otherwise specified under Article 124(9), institutions may use as eligible collateral residential property which is or will be occupied or let by the owner, or the beneficial owner in the case of personal investment companies, and commercial immovable property, including offices and other commercial premises, where both of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the property value does not materially depend upon the credit quality of the obligor;
- (b)the risk of the borrower does not materially depend upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the debt from other sources, and as a consequence the repayment of the facility does not materially depend on any cash flow generated by the underlying property serving as collateral.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the property value and the performance of the borrower.


**3.** Institutions may derogate from point (b) of paragraph 2 for exposures secured by residential property situated within the territory of a Member State, where the competent authority of that Member State has published evidence showing that a well-developed and long-established residential property market is present in that territory with loss rates that do not exceed any of the following limits:
- (a)the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (a), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (c), does not exceed 0,3 %;
- (b)the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (b), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (c), does not exceed 0,5 %.Where either of the conditions in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph is not met in a given year, institutions shall not use the treatment set out in that subparagraph until both conditions are satisfied in a subsequent year.


**4.** Institutions may derogate from point (b) of paragraph 2 for commercial immovable property situated within the territory of a Member State, where the competent authority of that Member State has published evidence showing that a well-developed and long-established commercial immovable property market is present in that territory with loss rates that do not exceed any of the following limits:
- (a)the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (d), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (f), does not exceed 0,3 %;
- (b)the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (e), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (f), does not exceed 0,5 %.Where either of the conditions in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph is not met in a given year, institutions shall not use the treatment set out in that subparagraph until both conditions are satisfied in a subsequent year.


**4a.** Institutions may also apply the derogations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article in cases where the competent authority of a third country which applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union as determined in a decision of the Commission adopted in accordance with Article 107(4), publishes corresponding loss rates for exposures secured by residential property or commercial immovable property situated within the territory of that third country.


**5.** Institutions may use as eligible collateral amounts receivable linked to a commercial transaction or transactions with an original maturity of less than or equal to one year. Eligible receivables do not include those associated with securitisations, sub-participations or credit derivatives or amounts owed by affiliated parties.Where a public development credit institution as defined in Article 429a(2) of this Regulation issues a promotional loan as defined in Article 429a(3) of this Regulation to another institution, or to a financial institution that is authorised to carry out activities as referred to in Annex I, point 2 or 3, to Directive 2013/36/EU and that meets the conditions set out in Article 119(5) of this Regulation, and where that other institution or financial institution passes through directly or indirectly that promotional loan to an ultimate obligor and cedes the receivable from the promotional loan as collateral to the public development credit institution, the public development credit institution may use the ceded receivable as eligible collateral, regardless of the original maturity of the ceded receivable.


**6.** Competent authorities shall permit an institution to use as eligible collateral physical collateral of a type other than those indicated in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)there are liquid markets, evidenced by frequent transactions taking into account the asset type, for the disposal of the collateral in an expeditious and economically efficient manner. Institutions shall carry out the assessment of this condition periodically and where information indicates material changes in the market;
- (b)there are well-established, publicly available market prices for the collateral. Institutions may consider market prices as well-established where they come from reliable sources of information such as public indices and reflect the price of the transactions under normal conditions. Institutions may consider market prices as publicly available, where these prices are disclosed, easily accessible, and obtainable regularly and without any undue administrative or financial burden;
- (c)the institution analyses the market prices, time and costs required to realise the collateral and the realised proceeds from the collateral;
- (d)the institution demonstrates that in at least 90 % of all liquidations for a given type of collateral the realised proceeds from the collateral are not below 70 % of the collateral value; where there is material volatility in the market prices, the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the competent authority that its valuation of the collateral is sufficiently conservative.Institutions shall document the fulfilment of the conditions specified in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph and those specified in Article 210.


**7.** Subject to the provisions of Article 230(2), where the requirements set out in Article 211 are met, exposures arising from transactions whereby an institution leases property to a third party may be treated in the same manner as loans collateralised by the type of property leased.


**8.** EBA shall disclose a list of types of physical collateral for which institutions can assume that the conditions referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 6 are met.


# Article 200

**Other funded credit protection**

*Article 200*

Institutions may use the following other funded credit protection as eligible collateral:
- (a)cash on deposit with, or cash assimilated instruments held by, a third party institution in a non-custodial arrangement and pledged to the lending institution;
- (b)life insurance policies pledged to the lending institution;
- (c)instruments issued by a third‐party institution or by an investment firm which are to be repurchased by that institution or by that investment firm on request.
# Article 201

**Eligibility of protection providers under all approaches**

*Article 201*


**1.** Institutions may use the following parties as eligible providers of unfunded credit protection:
- (a)central governments and central banks;
- (b)regional governments or local authorities;
- (c)multilateral development banks;
- (d)international organisations to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned in accordance with in Article 118;
- (e)public sector entities, claims on which are treated in accordance with Article 116;
- (f)institutions, and financial institutions for which exposures to the financial institution are treated as exposures to institutions in accordance with Article 119(5);
- (fa)regulated financial sector entities;
- (g)where the credit protection is not provided to a securitisation exposure, other undertakings, that have a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI, including parent undertakings, subsidiaries or affiliated entities of the obligor where a direct exposure to those parent undertakings, subsidiaries or affiliated entities has a lower risk weight than the exposure to the obligor;
- (h)qualifying central counterparties.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (fa), of this Article, "regulated financial sector entity" means a financial sector entity meeting the condition set out in Article 142(1), point (4)(b).


**2.** In addition to the protection providers listed in paragraph 1, corporate entities that are internally rated by the institution in accordance with Chapter 3, Section 6, shall be eligible providers of unfunded credit protection where the institution uses the IRB approach for exposures to those corporate entities.


# Article 202

**Eligibility of protection providers under the IRB Approach which qualify for the treatment set out in Article 153(3)**

*Article 202*

An institution may use institutions, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings and export credit agencies as eligible providers of unfunded credit protection which qualify for the treatment set out in Article 153(3) where they meet all the following conditions:
- (a)they have sufficient expertise in providing unfunded credit protection;
- (b)they are regulated in a manner equivalent to the rules laid down in this Regulation, or had, at the time the credit protection was provided, a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI which had been determined by EBA to be associated with credit quality step 3 or above in accordance with the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates set out in Chapter 2;
- (c)they had, at the time the credit protection was provided, or for any period of time thereafter, an internal rating with a PD equivalent to or lower than that associated with credit quality step 2 or above in accordance with the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates set out in Chapter 2;
- (d)they have an internal rating with a PD equivalent to or lower than that associated with credit quality step 3 or above in accordance with the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates set out in Chapter 2.For the purpose of this Article, credit protection provided by export credit agencies shall not benefit from any explicit central government counter-guarantee.
# Article 203

**Eligibility of guarantees as unfunded credit protection**

*Article 203*

Institutions may use guarantees as eligible unfunded credit protection.
# Article 204

**Eligible types of credit derivatives**

*Article 204*


**1.** Institutions may use the following types of credit derivatives, and instruments that may be composed of such credit derivatives or that are economically effectively similar, as eligible credit protection:
- (a)credit default swaps;
- (b)total return swaps;
- (c)credit linked notes to the extent of their cash funding.Where an institution buys credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on the swap as net income, but does not record the offsetting deterioration in the value of the asset that is protected either through reductions in fair value or by an addition to reserves, that credit protection does not qualify as eligible credit protection.


**2.** Where an institution conducts an internal hedge using a credit derivative, in order for the credit protection to qualify as eligible credit protection for the purposes of this Chapter, the credit risk transferred to the trading book shall be transferred out to a third party or parties.Where an internal hedge has been conducted in accordance with the first subparagraph and the requirements in this Chapter have been met, institutions shall apply the rules set out in Sections 4 to 6 for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts where they acquire unfunded credit protection.

# Article 207

**Requirements for financial collateral**

*Article 207*


**1.** Under all approaches and methods, financial collateral and gold shall qualify as eligible collateral where all the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 4 are met.


**2.** The credit quality of the obligor and the value of the collateral shall not have a material positive correlation. Where the value of the collateral is reduced significantly, this shall not alone imply a significant deterioration of the credit quality of the obligor. Where the credit quality of the obligor becomes critical, this shall not alone imply a significant reduction in the value of the collateral.Securities issued by the obligor, or any related group entity, shall not qualify as eligible collateral. This notwithstanding, the obligor's own issues of covered bonds falling within the terms of Article 129 qualify as eligible collateral when they are posted as collateral for a repurchase transaction, provided that they comply with the condition set out in the first subparagraph.


**3.** Institutions shall fulfil any contractual and statutory requirements in respect of, and take all steps necessary to ensure, the enforceability of the collateral arrangements under the law applicable to their interest in the collateral.Institutions shall have conducted sufficient legal review confirming the enforceability of the collateral arrangements in all relevant jurisdictions.

- (b)they shall use robust procedures and processes to control risks arising from the use of collateral, including risks of failed or reduced credit protection, valuation risks, risks associated with the termination of the credit protection, concentration risk arising from the use of collateral and the interaction with the institution's overall risk profile;
- (c)they shall have in place documented policies and practices concerning the types and amounts of collateral accepted;
- (d)they shall calculate the market value of the collateral, and revalue it accordingly, at least once every six months and whenever they have reason to believe that a significant decrease in the market value of the collateral has occurred; ESG-related considerations shall prompt an assessment of whether a significant decrease in the market value of the collateral has occurred;
- (e)where the collateral is held by a third party, they shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the third party segregates the collateral from its own assets;
- (f)they shall ensure that they devote sufficient resources to the orderly operation of margin agreements with OTC derivatives and securities-financing counterparties, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of their outgoing margin calls and response time to incoming margin calls;
- (g)they shall have in place collateral management policies to control, monitor and report the following:(i)the risks to which margin agreements expose them;(ii)the concentration risk to particular types of collateral assets;(iii)the reuse of collateral including the potential liquidity shortfalls resulting from the reuse of collateral received from counterparties;(iv)the surrender of rights on collateral posted to counterparties.


**5.** In addition to meeting all the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 to 4, for financial collateral to qualify as eligible collateral under the Financial Collateral Simple Method the residual maturity of the protection shall be at least as long as the residual maturity of the exposure.

Institutions carry out more frequent monitoring where the market is subject to significant changes in conditions;
- (b)the property valuation is reviewed when information available to institutions indicates that the property value may have declined materially relative to general market prices and that review is carried out by a valuer who possesses the necessary qualifications, ability and experience to execute a valuation and who is independent from the credit decision process; ESG-related considerations, including those related to limitations imposed by the relevant Union and Member States regulatory objectives and legal acts, as well as, where relevant for internationally active institutions, third-country legal and regulatory objectives, shall be considered to be an indication that the property value might have declined materially, relative to general market prices; for loans exceeding EUR 3 million or 5 % of the own funds of an institution, the property valuation shall be reviewed by such valuer at least every three years.Institutions may use statistical methods to monitor the value of the immovable property and to identify immovable property that needs revaluation.


**3a.** Institutions may monitor the value of the immovable property and identify the immovable property in need of revaluation, in accordance with paragraph 3, by means of advanced statistical or other mathematical methods ("models"), provided that those methods are developed independently from the credit decision process and all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institutions set out, in their policies and procedures, the criteria for using models to monitor the values of collateral and to identify the properties that should be revaluated; those policies and procedures shall account for such models’ proven track record, property-specific variables considered, the use of minimum available and accurate information, and the models’ uncertainty;
- (b)the institutions ensure that the models used are:(i)property- and location-specific at a sufficient level of granularity;(ii)valid and accurate, and subject to robust and regular back-testing against the actual observed transaction prices;(iii)based on a sufficiently large and representative sample, based on observed transaction prices;(iv)based on up-to-date data of high quality;

- (f)the estimates of models are independently validated and the validation process is generally consistent with the principles set out in Article 185, where applicable.


**4.** Institutions shall clearly document the types of residential property and commercial immovable property they accept and their lending policies in this regard.


**5.** The immovable property taken as credit protection shall be adequately insured against the risk of damage and institutions shall have in place procedures to monitor the adequacy of the insurance.By way of derogation from Article 92(5), point (a)(ii), and without prejudice to the derogation set out in Article 92(3), second subparagraph, for exposures secured by immovable property granted before 1 January 2025, institutions that apply the IRB Approach referred to in Chapter 3 of this Title by using their own estimates of LGD shall not be required to apply the provisions set out in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.

**3.** The following requirements on risk management shall be met:
- (a)an institution shall have in place a sound process for determining the credit risk associated with the receivables. Such a process shall include analyses of a borrower's business and industry and the types of customers with whom that borrower does business. Where the institution relies on its borrowers to ascertain the credit risk of the customers, the institution shall review the borrowers' credit practices to ascertain their soundness and credibility;
- (b)the difference between the amount of the exposure and the value of the receivables shall reflect all appropriate factors, including the cost of collection, concentration within the receivables pool pledged by an individual borrower, and potential concentration risk within the institution's total exposures beyond that controlled by the institution's general methodology. Institutions shall maintain a continuous monitoring process appropriate to the receivables. They shall also review, on a regular basis, compliance with loan covenants, environmental restrictions, and other legal requirements;

- (a)a central government or a central bank;
- (b)a regional government or a local authority;
- (c)a public sector entity, claims on which are treated as claims on the central government in accordance with Article 116(4);

# Article 221

**Using the internal models approach for master netting agreements**

*Article 221*


**1.** For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for securities financing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions other than derivative transactions covered by an eligible master netting agreement that meets the requirements set out in Chapter 6, Section 7, an institution may calculate the fully adjusted exposure value (E*) of the agreement using the internal model approach, provided that the institution meets the conditions set out in paragraph 2.


**2.** An institution may use the internal model approach where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution uses that approach only for exposures for which the risk-weighted exposures amounts are calculated under the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3;
- (b)the institution is granted the permission to use that approach by its competent authority.


**3.** An institution that uses an internal model approach shall do so for all counterparties and securities, with the exception of immaterial portfolios for which it may use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach laid down in Article 220.


**4.** Competent authorities shall permit an institution to use an internal models approach only where they are satisfied that the institution's system for managing the risks arising from the transactions covered by the master netting agreement is conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and where the following qualitative standards are met:

**6.** Institutions using the internal models approach shall calculate E* in accordance with the following formula:
$$E 
^{*} = \max
(0,
\left(
\sum
_{i} E
_{i} - 
\sum
_{i}C
_{i}\right) + potential change in value)$$
where:
- **Ei**=the exposure value for each separate exposure i under the agreement that would apply in the absence of the credit protection, where institutions calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach or where they calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach;
- **Ci**=the value of the securities borrowed, purchased or received or the cash borrowed or received in respect of each such exposure i.When calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts using internal models, institutions shall use the previous business day's model output.

- (a)it shall be carried out at least daily;
- (b)it shall be based on a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval;
- (c)it shall be based on a 5-day equivalent liquidation period, except in the case of transactions other than securities repurchase transactions or securities lending or borrowing transactions where a 10-day equivalent liquidation period shall be used;
- (d)it shall be based on an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility;
- (e)the data set used in the calculation shall be updated every three months.Where an institution has a repurchase transaction, a securities or commodities lending or borrowing transaction and margin lending or similar transaction or netting set which meets the criteria set out in Article 285(2), (3) and (4), the minimum holding period shall be brought in line with the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs, in combination with Article 285(5).


**8.** For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital market-driven transactions covered by master netting agreements, institutions shall use E* as calculated under paragraph 6 as the exposure value of the exposure to the counterparty arising from the transactions subject to the master netting agreement for the purposes of Article 113 under the Standardised Approach or Chapter 3 under the IRB Approach.


**9.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)what constitutes an immaterial portfolio for the purpose of paragraph 3;
- (b)the criteria for determining whether an internal model is sound and implemented with integrity for the purpose of paragraphs 4 and 5 and master netting agreements.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2015.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 222

**Financial Collateral Simple Method**

*Article 222*


**1.** Institutions may use the Financial Collateral Simple Method only where they calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach. Institution shall not use both the Financial Collateral Simple Method and the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, except for the purposes of Articles 148(1) and 150(1). Institutions shall not use this exception selectively with the purpose of achieving reduced own funds requirements or with the purpose of conducting regulatory arbitrage.


**2.** Under the Financial Collateral Simple Method institutions shall assign to eligible financial collateral a value equal to its market value as determined in accordance with point (d) of Article 207(4).


**3.** Institutions shall assign to those portions of exposure values that are collateralised by the market value of eligible collateral the risk weight that they would assign under Chapter 2 where the lending institution had a direct exposure to the collateral instrument. For that purpose, the exposure value of an off-balance-sheet item listed in Annex I shall be equal to 100 % of the item’s value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(2).


**4.** Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 0 % to the collateralised portion of the exposure arising from repurchase transaction and securities lending or borrowing transactions which fulfil the criteria in Article 227. Where the counterparty to the transaction is not a core market participant, institutions shall assign a risk weight of 10 %.


**5.** Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 0 %, to the extent of the collateralisation, to the exposure values determined under Chapter 6 for the derivative instruments listed in Annex II and subject to daily marking-to-market, collateralised by cash or cash assimilated instruments where there is no currency mismatch.Institutions shall assign a risk weight of 10 %, to the extent of the collateralisation, to the exposure values of such transactions collateralised by debt securities issued by central governments or central banks which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Chapter 2.


**6.** For transactions other than those referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, institutions may assign a 0 % risk weight where the exposure and the collateral are denominated in the same currency, and either of the following conditions is met:
- (a)the collateral is cash on deposit or a cash assimilated instrument;
- (b)the collateral is in the form of debt securities issued by central governments or central banks eligible for a 0 % risk weight under Article 114, and its market value has been discounted by 20 %.


**7.** For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 debt securities issued by central governments or central banks shall include:
- (a)debt securities issued by regional governments or local authorities exposures to which are treated as exposures to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established under Article 115;
- (b)debt securities issued by multilateral development banks to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned under or by virtue of Article 117(2);
- (c)debt securities issued by international organisations which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Article 118;
- (d)debt securities issued by public sector entities which are treated as exposures to central governments in accordance with Article 116(4).


# Article 223

**Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method**

*Article 223*


**1.** In order to take account of price volatility, institutions shall apply volatility adjustments to the market value of collateral, as set out in Articles 224 to 227, when valuing financial collateral for the purposes of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method.Where collateral is denominated in a currency that differs from the currency in which the underlying exposure is denominated, institutions shall add an adjustment reflecting currency volatility to the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral as set out in Articles 224 to 227.In the case of OTC derivatives transactions covered by netting agreements recognised by the competent authorities under Chapter 6, institutions shall apply a volatility adjustment reflecting currency volatility when there is a mismatch between the collateral currency and the settlement currency. Even where multiple currencies are involved in the transactions covered by the netting agreement, institutions shall apply a single volatility adjustment.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (CVA) they need to take into account as follows:
$$C
_{VA} = C  \times 
\left(1  - H
_{C} - H
_{fx}\right)$$
where:
- **C**=the value of the collateral;
- **HC**=the volatility adjustment appropriate to the collateral, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227;
- **Hfx**=the volatility adjustment appropriate to currency mismatch, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227.Institutions shall use the formula in this paragraph when calculating the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral for all transactions except for those transactions subject to recognised master netting agreements to which the provisions set out in Articles 220 and 221 apply.


**3.** Institutions shall calculate the volatility-adjusted value of the exposure (EVA) they need to take into account as follows:
$$E
_{VA} = E  \times 
\left(1 + H
_{E}\right)$$
where:
- **E**=the exposure value as would be determined under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, as applicable, where the exposure was not collateralised;
- **HE**=the volatility adjustment appropriate to the exposure, as calculated under Articles 224 and 227.In the case of OTC derivative transactions, institutions using the method laid down in Section 6 of Chapter 6 shall calculate EVA as follows:
- EVA = E.


**4.** For the purpose of calculating E in paragraph 3, the following shall apply:
- (a)for institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach, the exposure value of an off-balance-sheet item listed in Annex I shall be 100 % of that item’s value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(2);
- (b)for off-balance-sheet items other than derivatives treated under the IRB Approach, institutions shall calculate their exposure values using a CCF of 100 % instead of the SA-CCF or IRB-CCF provided for in Article 166(8), (8a) and (8b).


**5.** Institutions shall calculate the fully adjusted value of the exposure (E*), taking into account both volatility and the risk-mitigating effects of collateral as follows:
$$E 
^{*} = \max
(0, E
_{VA} - C
_{VAM})$$
where:
- **EVA**=the volatility adjusted value of the exposure as calculated in paragraph 3;
- **CVAM**=CVA further adjusted for any maturity mismatch in accordance with the provisions of Section 5;In the case of OTC derivative transactions, institutions using the methods laid down in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6 shall take into account the risk-mitigating effects of collateral in accordance with the provisions laid down in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6, as applicable.


**6.** Institutions shall calculate volatility adjustments by using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach referred to in Articles 224 to 227.


**7.** Where the collateral consists of a number of eligible items, institutions shall calculate the volatility adjustment (H) as follows:
$$H = 
\sum
_{i}a
_{i}H
_{i}$$
where:
- **ai**=the proportion of the value of an eligible item 
*i* in the total value of collateral;
- **Hi**=the volatility adjustment applicable to eligible item 
*i*.

- (a)for secured lending transactions the liquidation period shall be 20 business days;
- (b)for repurchase transactions, except insofar as such transactions involve the transfer of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities, and securities lending or borrowing transactions the liquidation period shall be 5 business days;
- (c)for other capital market driven transactions, the liquidation period shall be 10 business days.Where an institution has a transaction or netting set which meets the criteria set out in Article 285(2), (3) and (4), the minimum holding period shall be brought in line with the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs.

**4.** For non-eligible securities or for commodities lent or sold under repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, the volatility adjustment is the same as for non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange.


**5.** For eligible units in CIUs the volatility adjustment is the weighted average volatility adjustments that would apply, having regard to the liquidation period of the transaction as specified in paragraph 2, to the assets in which the fund has invested.Where the assets in which the fund has invested are not known to the institution, the volatility adjustment is the highest volatility adjustment that would apply to any of the assets in which the fund has the right to invest.


**6.** For unrated debt securities issued by institutions or investment firms and satisfying the eligibility criteria in Article 197(4), the volatility adjustments is the same as for securities issued by institutions or corporates with an external credit assessment associated with credit quality step 2 or 3.


# Article 225

**Own estimates of volatility adjustments under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method**

*Article 225*


**1.** The competent authorities shall permit institutions to use their own volatility estimates for calculating the volatility adjustments to be applied to collateral and exposures where those institutions comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. Institutions which have obtained permission to use their own volatility estimates shall not revert to the use of other methods except for demonstrated good cause and subject to the permission of the competent authorities.For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI equivalent to investment grade or better, institutions may calculate a volatility estimate for each category of security.For debt securities that have a credit assessment from an ECAI equivalent to below investment grade, and for other eligible collateral, institutions shall calculate the volatility adjustments for each individual item.Institutions using the Own Estimates Approach shall estimate volatility of the collateral or foreign exchange mismatch without taking into account any correlations between the unsecured exposure, collateral or exchange rates.In determining relevant categories, institutions shall take into account the type of issuer of the security, the external credit assessment of the securities, their residual maturity, and their modified duration. Volatility estimates shall be representative of the securities included in the category by the institution.


**2.** The calculation of the volatility adjustments shall be subject to all the following criteria:
- (a)institutions shall base the calculation on a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval;
- (b)institutions shall base the calculation on the following liquidation periods:(i)20 business days for secured lending transactions;(ii)5 business days for repurchase transactions, except insofar as such transactions involve the transfer of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities and securities lending or borrowing transactions;(iii)10 business days for other capital market driven transactions;
- (c)institutions may use volatility adjustment numbers calculated in accordance with shorter or longer liquidation periods, scaled up or down to the liquidation period set out in point (b) for the type of transaction in question, using the square root of time formula:
$$H
_{M} = H
_{N} \times 
\frac{T
_{M}}{T
_{N}}$$
where:
- **TM**=the relevant liquidation period;
- **HM**=the volatility adjustment based on the liquidation period TM;
- **HN**=the volatility adjustment based on the liquidation period TN.
- (d)institutions shall take into account the illiquidity of lower-quality assets. They shall adjust the liquidation period upwards in cases where there is doubt concerning the liquidity of the collateral. They shall also identify where historical data may understate potential volatility. Such cases shall be dealt with by means of a stress scenario;
- (e)the length of the historical observation period institutions use for calculating volatility adjustments shall be at least one year. For institutions that use a weighting scheme or other methods for the historical observation period, the length of the effective observation period shall be at least one year. The competent authorities may also require an institution to calculate its volatility adjustments using a shorter observation period where, in the competent authorities' judgement, this is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility;
- (f)institutions shall update their data sets and calculate volatility adjustments at least once every three months. They shall also reassess their data sets whenever market prices are subject to material changes.


**3.** The estimation of volatility adjustments shall meet all the following qualitative criteria:
- (a)an institutions shall use the volatility estimates in the day-to-day risk management process including in relation to its internal exposure limits;
- (b)where the liquidation period used by an institution in its day-to-day risk management process is longer than that set out in this Section for the type of transaction in question, that institution shall scale up its volatility adjustments in accordance with the square root of time formula set out in point (c) of paragraph 2;
- (c)an institution shall have in place established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of policies and controls for the operation of its system for the estimation of volatility adjustments and for the integration of such estimations into its risk management process;
- (d)an independent review of the institution's system for the estimation of volatility adjustments shall be carried out regularly within the institution's own internal auditing process. A review of the overall system for the estimation of volatility adjustments and for the integration of those adjustments into the institution's risk management process shall take place at least once a year. The subject of that review shall include at least the following:(i)the integration of estimated volatility adjustments into daily risk management;(ii)the validation of any significant change in the process for the estimation of volatility adjustments;(iii)the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources used to run the system for the estimation of volatility adjustments, including the independence of such data sources;(iv)the accuracy and appropriateness of the volatility assumptions.

**Scaling up of volatility adjustment under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method**

*Article 226*

The volatility adjustments set out in Article 224 are the volatility adjustments an institution shall apply where there is daily revaluation. Where the frequency of revaluation is less than daily, institutions shall apply larger volatility adjustments. Institutions shall calculate them by scaling up the daily revaluation volatility adjustments, using the following square-root-of-time formula:

# Article 227

**Conditions for applying a 0 % volatility adjustment under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method**

*Article 227*


**1.** Institutions that use the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach referred to in Article 224, may, for repurchase transactions and securities lending or borrowing transactions, apply a 0 % volatility adjustment instead of the volatility adjustments calculated under Articles 224 and 226, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 2, points (a) to (h), of this Article are satisfied. Institutions that use the internal model approach set out in Article 221 shall not use the treatment set out in this Article.


**2.** Institutions may apply a 0 % volatility adjustment where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)both the exposure and the collateral are cash or debt securities issued by central governments or central banks within the meaning of Article 197(1)(b) and eligible for a 0 % risk weight under Chapter 2;
- (b)both the exposure and the collateral are denominated in the same currency;
- (c)either the maturity of the transaction is no more than one day or both the exposure and the collateral are subject to daily marking-to-market or daily re-margining;
- (d)the time between the last marking-to-market before a failure to re-margin by the counterparty and the liquidation of the collateral is no more than four business days;
- (e)the transaction is settled in a settlement system proven for that type of transaction;
- (f)the documentation covering the agreement or transaction is standard market documentation for repurchase transactions or securities lending or borrowing transactions in the securities concerned;
- (g)the transaction is governed by documentation specifying that where the counterparty fails to satisfy an obligation to deliver cash or securities or to deliver margin or otherwise defaults, then the transaction is immediately terminable;
- (h)the counterparty is considered a core market participant by the competent authorities.


**3.** The core market participants referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 shall include the following entities:
- (a)the entities mentioned in Article 197(1)(b) exposures to which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Chapter 2;
- (b)institutions;
- (ba)investment firms;
- (c)other financial undertakings within the meaning of points (25)(b) and (d) of Article 13 of Directive 2009/138/EC exposures to which are assigned a 20 % risk weight under the Standardised Approach or which, in the case of institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the IRB Approach, do not have a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI and are internally rated by the institution;
- (d)regulated CIUs that are subject to capital or leverage requirements;
- (e)regulated pension funds;
- (f)recognised clearing organisations.


# Article 228

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive method for exposures treated under the Standardised Approach**

*Article 228*

Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall use E* as calculated under Article 223(5) as the exposure value for the purposes of Article 113. In the case of off-balance-sheet items listed in Annex I, institutions shall use E* as the value to which the percentages indicated in Article 111(2) shall be applied to arrive at the exposure value.
# Article 229

**Valuation principles for eligible collateral other than financial collateral**

*Article 229*


**1.** The valuation of immovable property shall meet all of the following requirements:
- (a)the value is appraised independently from an institution’s mortgage acquisition, loan processing and loan decision process by an independent valuer who possesses the necessary qualifications, ability and experience to execute a valuation;
- (b)the value is appraised using prudently conservative valuation criteria which meet all of the following requirements:(i)the value excludes expectations on price increases;(ii)the value is adjusted to take into account the potential for the current market value to be significantly above the value that would be sustainable over the life of the loan;
- (c)the value is documented in a transparent and clear manner;
- (d)the value is not higher than a market value for the immovable property where such market value can be determined;
- (e)where the property is revalued, the property value does not exceed the average value measured for that property, or for a comparable property over the last six years for residential property or eight years for commercial immovable property or the value at origination, whichever is higher.For the purpose of calculating the average value, institutions shall take the average across property values observed at equal intervals and the reference period shall include at least three data points.For the purpose of calculating the average value, institutions may use the results of the monitoring of property values in accordance with Article 208(3). The property value may exceed that average value or the value at origination, as applicable, in the case of modifications made to the property that unequivocally increase its value, such as improvements of the energy performance or improvements to the resilience, protection and adaptation to physical risks of the building or housing unit. The property value shall not be revalued upward if institutions do not have sufficient data to calculate the average value except if the value increase is based on modifications that unequivocally increase its value.The valuation of immovable property shall take account of any prior claims on the property, unless a prior claim is taken into account in the calculation of the gross exposure amount pursuant to Article 124(6), point (c), or as reducing the amount of 55 % of the property value pursuant to Article 125(1) or Article 126(1), and reflect, where applicable, the results of the monitoring required under Article 208(3).


**2.** For receivables, the value of receivables shall be the amount receivable.


**3.** Institutions shall value physical collateral other than immovable property at its market value. For the purposes of this Article, the market value is the estimated amount for which the property would exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria and factors to be considered for the assessment of the term "comparable property", as referred to in paragraph 1, point (e).EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2027.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 230

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for an exposure with an eligible funded credit protection under the IRB Approach**

*Article 230*


**1.** Under the IRB Approach, except for those exposures that fall under the scope of Article 220, institutions shall use the effective LGD (LGD*) as the LGD for the purposes of Chapter 3 to recognise funded credit protection eligible pursuant to this Chapter. Institutions shall calculate LGD* as follows:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.009801.fmx.tif]*

  where:
- **E**: = the exposure value before taking into account the effect of the funded credit protection; for an exposure secured by financial collateral eligible in accordance with this Chapter, that amount shall be calculated in accordance with Article 223(3); in the case of securities lent or posted, that amount shall be equal to the cash lent or securities lent or posted; for securities that are lent or posted, the exposure value shall be increased by applying the volatility adjustment (HE) in accordance with Articles 223 to 227;
- **ES**: = the current value of the funded credit protection received after the application of the volatility adjustment applicable to that type of funded credit protection (HC) and the application of the volatility adjustment for currency mismatches (Hfx) between the exposure and the funded credit protection, in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3; ES shall be capped at the following value: E·(1+HE);
- **EU**: = E·(1+HE) – ES;
- **LGDU**: = the applicable LGD for an unsecured exposure as set out in Article 161(1);
- **LGDS**: = the applicable LGD to exposures secured by the type of eligible FCP used in the transaction, as specified in paragraph 2, Table 1.


**2.** Table 1 specifies the values of LGDS and Hc applicable in the formula set out in paragraph 1.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type of FCP | LGDS | Volatility adjustment (Hc) | 
| Financial collateral | 0 % | Volatility adjustment Hc as set out in Articles 224 to 227 | 
| Receivables | 20 % | 40 % | 
| Residential property and commercial immovable property | 20 % | 40 % | 
| Other physical collateral | 25 % | 40 % | 
| Ineligible FCP | Not applicable | 100 % |


**3.** Where an eligible funded credit protection is denominated in a different currency than that of the exposure, the volatility adjustment for currency mismatch (Hfx) shall be the same as the one that applies pursuant to Articles 224 to 227.


**4.** As an alternative to the treatment set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and subject to Article 124(9), institutions may assign a 50 % risk weight to the part of the exposure that is, within the limits set out in Article 125(1), first subparagraph, and Article 126(1), first subparagraph, respectively, fully collateralised by residential property or commercial immovable property situated within the territory of a Member State where all of the conditions set out in Article 199(3) or (4) are met.


**5.** To calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for IRB exposures that fall within the scope of Article 220, institutions shall use E* in accordance with Article 220(4) and shall use LGD for unsecured exposures, as set out in Article 161(1), points (a), (aa) and (b).


# Article 231

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in the case of pools of eligible funded credit protection for an exposure treated under the IRB Approach**

*Article 231*

Institutions that have obtained multiple types of funded credit protection may, for exposures treated under the IRB Approach, apply the formula set out in Article 230, sequentially for each individual type of collateral. For that purpose, those institutions shall, after each step of recognising one individual type of FCP, reduce the remaining value of the unsecured exposure (EU) by the adjusted value of the collateral (ES) recognised in that step. In accordance with Article 230(1), the total of ES across all funded credit protection types shall be capped at the value of E·(1+HE), resulting in the following formula:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.009901.fmx.tif]*

  where:
- **LGDS,i**: = the LGD applicable to FCP i, as specified in Article 230(2);
- **ES,i**: = the current value of FCP i received after the application of the volatility adjustment applicable for the type of FCP (Hc) pursuant to Article 230(2).
# Article 232

**Other funded credit protection**

*Article 232*


**1.** Where the conditions set out in Article 212(1) are met, cash on deposit with, or cash assimilated instruments held by, a third-party institution in a non-custodial arrangement and pledged to the lending institution, may be treated as a guarantee provided by the third-party institution.


**2.** Where the conditions set out in Article 212(2) are met, institutions shall subject the portion of the exposure collateralised by the current surrender value of life insurance policies pledged to the lending institution to the following treatment:
- (a)where the exposure is subject to the Standardised Approach, it shall be risk-weighted by using the risk weights specified in paragraph 3;
- (b)where the exposure is subject to the IRB Approach but not subject to the institution's own estimates of LGD, it shall be assigned an LGD of 40 %.In the event of a currency mismatch, institutions shall reduce the current surrender value in accordance with Article 233(3), the value of the credit protection being the current surrender value of the life insurance policy.


**3.** For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 2, institutions shall assign the following risk weights on the basis of the risk weight assigned to a senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance:
- (a)a risk weight of 20 %, where the senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance is assigned a risk weight of 20 %;
- (b)a risk weight of 35 %, where the senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance is assigned a risk weight of 50 %;
- (ba)a risk weight of 52,5 %, where the senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance is assigned a risk weight of 75 %;
- (c)a risk weight of 70 %, where the senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance is assigned a risk weight of 100 %;
- (d)a risk weight of 150 %, where the senior unsecured exposure to the undertaking providing the life insurance is assigned a risk weight of 150 %.


**4.** Institutions may treat instruments repurchased on request that are eligible under Article 200(c) as a guarantee by the issuing institution. The value of the eligible credit protection shall be the following:
- (a)where the instrument will be repurchased at its face value, the value of the protection shall be that amount;
- (b)where the instrument will be repurchased at market price, the value of the protection shall be the value of the instrument valued in the same way as the debt securities that meet the conditions in Article 197(4).


# Article 233

**Valuation**

*Article 233*


**1.** For the purpose of calculating the effects of unfunded credit protection in accordance with this Sub-section, the value of unfunded credit protection (G) shall be the amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay in the event of the default or non-payment of the borrower or on the occurrence of other specified credit events.


**2.** In the case of credit derivatives which do not include as a credit event restructuring of the underlying obligation involving forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest or fees that result in a credit loss event the following shall apply:
- (a)where the amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay is not higher than the exposure value, institutions shall reduce the value of the credit protection calculated under paragraph 1 by 40 %;
- (b)where the amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay is higher than the exposure value, the value of the credit protection shall be no higher than 60 % of the exposure value.


**3.** Where unfunded credit protection is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated, institutions shall reduce the value of the credit protection by the application of a volatility adjustment as follows:
$$G* = G  \times 
\left(1  - H
_{fx}\right)$$
where:
- **G***=the amount of credit protection adjusted for foreign exchange risk,
- **G**=the nominal amount of the credit protection;
- **Hfx**=the volatility adjustment for any currency mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying obligation determined in accordance with paragraph 4.Where there is no currency mismatch Hfx is equal to zero.


**4.** Institutions shall base the volatility adjustments for any currency mismatch on a 10 business day liquidation period, assuming daily revaluation, and shall calculate those adjustments based on the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach as set out in Article 224. Institutions shall scale up the volatility adjustments in accordance with Article 226.


# Article 234

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in the event of partial protection and tranching**

*Article 234*

Where an institution transfers a part of the risk of a loan in one or more tranches, the rules set out in Chapter 5 shall apply. Institutions may consider materiality thresholds on payments below which no payment shall be made in the event of loss to be equivalent to retained first loss positions and to give rise to a tranched transfer of risk.
# Article 235

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts under the substitution approach where the guaranteed exposure is treated under the Standardised Approach**

*Article 235*


**1.** For the purposes of Article 113(3), institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for exposures with unfunded credit protection to which those institutions apply the Standardised Approach, irrespective of the treatment of comparable direct exposure to the protection provider, in accordance with the following formula:
*max {0, E – GA} · r + GA · g*where:
- **E**: = the exposure value calculated in accordance with Article 111; for that purpose, the exposure value of an off-balance-sheet item listed in Annex I shall be 100 % of its value rather than the exposure value indicated in Article 111(2);
- **GA**: = the amount of credit protection adjusted for foreign exchange risk (G*) as calculated under Article 233(3) further adjusted for any maturity mismatch as laid down in Section 5 of this Chapter;
- **r**: = the risk weight of exposures to the obligor as specified in Chapter 2;
- **g**: = the risk weight applicable to a direct exposure to the protection provider as specified in Chapter 2.


**2.** Where the protected amount (GA) is less than the exposure (E), institutions may apply the formula specified in paragraph 1 only where the protected and unprotected parts of the exposure are of equal seniority.


**3.** Institutions may extend the preferential treatment set out in Article 114(4) and (7), to exposures or parts of exposures guaranteed by the central government or the central bank as if those exposures were direct exposures to the central government or the central bank, provided that the conditions set out in Article 114(4) or (7), as applicable, are met for such direct exposures.


# Article 235a

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the substitution approach where the guaranteed exposure is treated under the IRB Approach and a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider is treated under the Standardised Approach**

*Article 235A*


**1.** For exposures with unfunded credit protection to which an institution applies the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3 and where comparable direct exposures to the protection provider are treated under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with the following formula:
*max {0, E – GA} · r + GA · g*where:
- **E**: = the exposure value determined in accordance with Chapter 3, Section 5; for that purpose, institutions shall calculate the exposure value for off-balance-sheet items other than derivatives treated under the IRB Approach using a CCF of 100 % instead of the SA-CCFs or IRB-CCF provided for in Article 166(8), (8a) and (8b);
- **GA**: = the amount of credit protection adjusted for foreign exchange risk (G*) as calculated in accordance with Article 233(3) further adjusted for any maturity mismatch as laid down in Section 5 of this Chapter;
- **r**: = the risk weight of exposures to the obligor as specified in Chapter 3;
- **g**: = the risk weight applicable to a direct exposure to the protection provider as specified in Chapter 2.


**2.** Where the amount of credit protection (GA) is less than the exposure value (E), institutions may apply the formula specified in paragraph 1 only where the protected and unprotected parts of the exposure are of equal seniority.


**3.** Institutions may extend the preferential treatment set out in Article 114(4) and (7), to exposures or parts of exposures guaranteed by the central government or the central bank as if those exposures were direct exposures to the central government or the central bank, provided that the conditions set out in Article 114(4) or (7), as applicable, are met for such direct exposures.


**4.** The expected loss amount for the covered part of the exposure value shall be zero.


**5.** For any uncovered part of the exposure value (E), institutions shall use the risk weight and the expected loss corresponding to the underlying exposure. For the calculation set out in Article 159, institutions shall assign any general or specific credit risk adjustments or additional value adjustments in accordance with Article 34 related to the non-trading book business of the institution or other own funds reductions related to the exposure other than the deductions made in accordance with Article 36(1), point (m), to the uncovered part of the exposure value.


# Article 236

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the substitution approach where the guaranteed exposure is treated under the IRB Approach without the use of own estimates of LGD and a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider is treated under the IRB Approach**

*Article 236*


**1.** For an exposure with unfunded credit protection to which an institution applies the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3, but without using its own estimates of LGD, and where comparable direct exposures to the protection provider are treated under the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3, the institution shall determine the covered part of the exposure as the lower of the exposure value (E) and the adjusted value of the unfunded credit protection (GA).


**1a.** Institutions that apply the IRB Approach to comparable direct exposures to the protection provider using own estimates of PD shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount and the expected loss amount for the covered part of the exposure value by using the PD of the protection provider and the LGD applicable for a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider as referred to in Article 161(1), in accordance with paragraph 1b of this Article. For subordinated exposures and non-subordinated unfunded credit protection, the LGD to be applied by institutions to the covered part of the exposure value shall be the LGD associated with senior claims and the institutions may account for any funded credit protection securing the unfunded credit protection in accordance with this Chapter.


**1b.** Institutions shall calculate the risk weight and expected loss applicable to the covered part of the underlying exposure using the PD, the LGD specified in paragraph 1a of this Article, and the same risk weight function as the ones used for a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider, and shall, where applicable, use the maturity (M) related to the underlying exposure, calculated in accordance with Article 162.


**1c.** Institutions that apply the IRB Approach to comparable direct exposures to the protection provider using the method provided for in Article 153(5) shall use the risk weight and expected loss applicable to the covered part of the exposure that correspond to the ones provided for in Articles 153(5) and 158(6).


**1d.** Notwithstanding paragraph 1c of this Article, institutions that apply the IRB Approach to guaranteed exposures using the method provided for in Article 153(5) shall calculate the risk weight and expected loss applicable to the covered part of the exposure using the PD, the LGD applicable for a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider as referred to in Article 161(1), in accordance with paragraph 1b of this Article, and the same risk weight function as the ones used for a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider, and shall, where applicable, use the maturity (M) related to the underlying exposure, calculated in accordance with Article 162. For subordinated exposures and non-subordinated unfunded credit protection, the LGD to be applied by institutions to the covered part of the exposure value shall be the LGD associated with senior claims and the institutions may account for any funded credit protection securing the unfunded credit protection in accordance with this Chapter.


**2.** For any uncovered part of the exposure value (E), institutions shall use the risk weight and the expected loss corresponding to the underlying exposure. For the calculation set out in Article 159, institutions shall assign any general or specific credit risk adjustments or additional value adjustments in accordance with Article 34 related to the non-trading book business of the institution or other own funds reductions related to the exposure other than the deductions made in accordance with Article 36(1), point (m), to the uncovered part of the exposure value.


**3.** For the purposes of this Article, (GA) is the amount of credit protection adjusted for foreign exchange risk (G*) as calculated under Article 233(3) further adjusted for any maturity mismatch as laid down in Section 5 of this Chapter. The exposure value (E) is the exposure value determined in accordance with Chapter 3, Section 5. Institutions shall calculate the exposure value for off-balance-sheet items other than derivatives treated under the IRB Approach using a CCF of 100 % instead of the SA-CCFs or IRB-CCF provided for in Article 166(8), (8a) and (8b).


# Article 236a

**Calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts under the substitution approach where the guaranteed exposure is treated under the IRB Approach using own estimates of LGD and a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider is treated under the IRB Approach**

*Article 236A*


**1.** For an exposure with unfunded credit protection to which an institution applies the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3 using its own estimates of LGD and where comparable direct exposures to the protection provider are treated under the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3, but without using its own estimates of LGD, the institution shall determine the covered part of the exposure as the lower of the exposure value (E) and the adjusted value of the unfunded credit protection (GA), calculated in accordance with Article 235a(1). The institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount and the expected loss amount for the covered part of the exposure value by using the PD, the LGD and the same risk weight function as the ones used for a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider, and shall, where applicable, use the maturity (M) related to the underlying exposure, calculated in accordance with Article 162.


**2.** Institutions that apply the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3, but without using their own estimates of LGD to comparable direct exposures to the protection provider, shall determine the LGD in accordance with Article 161(1). For subordinated exposures and non-subordinated unfunded credit protection, the LGD to be applied by institutions to the covered part of the exposure value shall be the LGD associated with senior claims and the institutions may account for any funded credit protection securing the unfunded credit protection in accordance with this Chapter.


**3.** Institutions that apply the IRB Approach set out in Chapter 3 using their own estimates of LGD to comparable direct exposures to the protection provider shall calculate the risk weight and the expected loss applicable to the covered part of the underlying exposure using the PD, the LGD and the same risk weight function as the ones used for a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider, and shall, where applicable, use the maturity (M) related to the underlying exposure, calculated in accordance with Article 162.


**4.** Institutions that apply the IRB Approach to comparable direct exposures to the protection provider using the method provided for in Article 153(5) shall use the risk weight and expected loss applicable to the covered part of the exposure that correspond to the ones provided in Articles 153(5) and 158(6).


**5.** For any uncovered part of the exposure value (E), institutions shall use the risk weight and the expected loss corresponding to the underlying exposure. For the calculation set out in Article 159, institutions shall assign any general or specific credit risk adjustments or additional value adjustments in accordance with Article 34 related to the non-trading book business of the institution or other own funds reductions related to the exposure other than the deductions made in accordance with Article 36(1), point (m), to the uncovered part of the exposure value.


# Article 237

**Maturity mismatch**

*Article 237*


**1.** For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts, a maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of the credit protection is less than that of the protected exposure. Where protection has a residual maturity of less than three months and the maturity of the protection is less than the maturity of the underlying exposure that protection does not qualify as eligible credit protection.


**2.** Where there is a maturity mismatch the credit protection shall not qualify as eligible where either of the following conditions is met:
- (a)the original maturity of the protection is less than one year;
- (b)the exposure is a short term exposure specified by the competent authorities as being subject to a one-day floor rather than a one-year floor in respect of the maturity value (M) under Article 162(3).


# Article 238

**Maturity of credit protection**

*Article 238*


**1.** Subject to a maximum of five years, the effective maturity of the underlying shall be the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil its obligations. Subject to paragraph 2, the maturity of the credit protection shall be the time to the earliest date at which the protection may terminate or be terminated.


**2.** Where there is an option to terminate the protection which is at the discretion of the protection seller, institutions shall take the maturity of the protection to be the time to the earliest date at which that option may be exercised. Where there is an option to terminate the protection which is at the discretion of the protection buyer and the terms of the arrangement at origination of the protection contain a positive incentive for the institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, an institution shall take the maturity of the protection to be the time to the earliest date at which that option may be exercised; otherwise the institution may consider that such an option does not affect the maturity of the protection.


**3.** Where a credit derivative is not prevented from terminating prior to expiration of any grace period required for a default on the underlying obligation to occur as a result of a failure to pay institutions shall reduce the maturity of the protection by the length of the grace period.


# Article 239

**Valuation of protection**

*Article 239*


**1.** For transactions subject to funded credit protection under the Financial Collateral Simple Method, where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection, the collateral does not qualify as eligible funded credit protection.


**2.** For transactions subject to funded credit protection under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, institutions shall reflect the maturity of the credit protection and of the exposure in the adjusted value of the collateral in accordance with the following formula:
$$C
_{VAM} = C
_{VA} \times 
\frac{t  -  t*}{T  -  t*}$$
where:
- **CVA**=the volatility adjusted value of the collateral as specified in Article 223(2) or the amount of the exposure, whichever is lower;
- **t**=the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the credit protection calculated in accordance with Article 238, or the value of T, whichever is lower;
- **T**=the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the exposure calculated in accordance with Article 238, or five years, whichever is lower;
- **t***=0,25.Institutions shall use CVAM as CVA further adjusted for maturity mismatch in the formula for the calculation of the fully adjusted value of the exposure (E*) set out in Article 223(5).


**3.** For transactions subject to unfunded credit protection, institutions shall reflect the maturity of the credit protection and of the exposure in the adjusted value of the credit protection in accordance with the following formula:
$$G
_{A} = G* \times 
\frac{t  -  t*}{T  -  t*}$$
where:
- **GA**=G* adjusted for any maturity mismatch;
- **G***=the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency mismatch;
- **t**=is the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the credit protection calculated in accordance with Article 238, or the value of T, whichever is lower;
- **T**=is the number of years remaining to the maturity date of the exposure calculated in accordance with Article 238, or five years, whichever is lower;
- **t***=0,25.Institutions shall use GA as the value of the protection for the purposes of Articles 233 to 236.


# Article 240

**First-to-default credit derivatives**

*Article 240*

Where an institution obtains credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the first default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the institution may amend the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount and, as relevant, the expected loss amount of the exposure which would, in the absence of the credit protection, produce the lowest risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with this Chapter:
- (a)for institutions using the Standardised Approach, the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be that calculated under the Standardised Approach;
- (b)for institutions using the IRB Approach, the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be the sum of the risk-weighted exposure amount calculated under the IRB Approach and 12,5 times the expected loss amount.The treatment set out in this Article applies only where the exposure value is less than or equal to the value of the credit protection.
# Article 241

**Nth-to-default credit derivatives**

*Article 241*

Where the nth default among the exposures triggers payment under the credit protection, the institution purchasing the protection may only recognise the protection for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and, as applicable, expected loss amounts where protection has also been obtained for defaults 1 to n-1 or when n-1 defaults have already occurred. In such cases, the institution may amend the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amount and, as applicable, the expected loss amount of the exposure which would, in the absence of the credit protection, produce the n-th lowest risk-weighted exposure amount in accordance with this Chapter. Institutions shall calculate the nth lowest amount as specified in points (a) and (b) of Article 240.The treatment set out in this Article applies only where the exposure value is less than or equal to the value of the credit protection.All exposures in the basket shall meet the requirements laid down in Article 204(2) and Article 216(1)(d).
# Article 242

**Definitions**

**Criteria for STS securitisations qualifying for differentiated capital treatment**

*Article 243*


**1.** Positions in an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction that qualify as positions in an STS securitisation shall be eligible for the treatment set out in Articles 260, 262 and 264 where the following requirements are met:
- (a)the underlying exposures meet, at the time of their inclusion in the ABCP programme, to the best knowledge of the originator or the original lender, the conditions for being assigned, under the Standardised Approach and taking into account any eligible credit risk mitigation, a risk weight equal to or smaller than 75 % on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a retail exposure or 100 % for any other exposures; and
- (b)the aggregate exposure value of all exposures to a single obligor at ABCP programme level does not exceed 2 % of the aggregate exposure value of all exposures within the ABCP programme at the time the exposures were added to the ABCP programme. For the purposes of this calculation, loans or leases to a group of connected clients, to the best knowledge of the sponsor, shall be considered as exposures to a single obligor.In the case of trade receivables, point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not apply where the credit risk of those trade receivables is fully covered by eligible credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4, provided that in that case the protection provider is an institution, an investment firm, an insurance undertaking or a reinsurance undertaking.In the case of securitised residual leasing values, point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not apply where those values are not exposed to refinancing or resell risk due to a legally enforceable commitment to repurchase or refinance the exposure at a pre-determined amount by a third party eligible under Article 201(1).By way of derogation from point (a) of the first subparagraph, where an institution applies Article 248(3) or has been granted permission to apply the Internal Assessment Approach in accordance with Article 265, the risk weight that institution would assign to a liquidity facility that completely covers the ABCP issued under the programme is equal to or smaller than 100 %.


**2.** Positions in a securitisation, other than an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction, that qualify as positions in an STS securitisation, shall be eligible for the treatment set out in Articles 260, 262 and 264 where the following requirements are met:
- (a)at the time of inclusion in the securitisation, the aggregate exposure value of all exposures to a single obligor in the pool does not exceed 2 % of the exposure values of the aggregate outstanding exposure values of the pool of underlying exposures. For the purposes of this calculation, loans or leases to a group of connected clients shall be considered as exposures to a single obligor.In the case of securitised residual leasing values, the first subparagraph of this point shall not apply where those values are not exposed to refinancing or resell risk due to a legally enforceable commitment to repurchase or refinance the exposure at a pre-determined amount by a third party eligible under Article 201(1);
- (b)at the time of their inclusion in the securitisation, the underlying exposures meet the conditions for being assigned, under the Standardised Approach and taking into account any eligible credit risk mitigation, a risk weight equal to or smaller than:(i)40 % on an exposure value-weighted average basis for the portfolio where the exposures are loans secured by residential mortgages or fully guaranteed residential loans, as referred to in point (e) of Article 129(1);(ii)50 % on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a loan secured by a commercial mortgage;(iii)75 % on an individual exposure basis where the exposure is a retail exposure;(iv)for any other exposures, 100 % on an individual exposure basis;
- (c)where points (b)(i) and (b)(ii) apply, the loans secured by lower ranking security rights on a given asset shall only be included in the securitisation where all loans secured by prior ranking security rights on that asset are also included in the securitisation;
- (d)where point (b)(i) of this paragraph applies, no loan in the pool of underlying exposures shall have a loan-to-value ratio higher than 100 %, at the time of inclusion in the securitisation, measured in accordance with point (d)(i) of Article 129(1) and Article 229(1).


# Article 244

**Traditional securitisation**

*Article 244*


**1.** The originator institution of a traditional securitisation may exclude underlying exposures from its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and, where relevant, expected loss amounts if either of the following conditions is fulfilled:
- (a)significant credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been transferred to third parties;
- (b)the originator institution applies a 1 250 % risk weight to all securitisation positions it holds in the securitisation or deducts these securitisation positions from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1).


**2.** Significant credit risk shall be considered as transferred in either of the following cases:
- (a)the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the mezzanine securitisation positions held by the originator institution in the securitisation do not exceed 50 % of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of all mezzanine securitisation positions existing in this securitisation;
- (b)the originator institution does not hold more than 20 % of the exposure value of the first loss tranche in the securitisation, provided that both of the following conditions are met:(i)the originator can demonstrate that the exposure value of the first loss tranche exceeds a reasoned estimate of the expected loss on the underlying exposures by a substantial margin;(ii)there are no mezzanine securitisation positions.Where the possible reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts, which the originator institution would achieve by the securitisation under points (a) or (b), is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, competent authorities may decide on a case-by-case basis that significant credit risk shall not be considered as transferred to third parties.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2, competent authorities may allow originator institutions to recognise significant credit risk transfer in relation to a securitisation where the originator institution demonstrates in each case that the reduction in own funds requirements which the originator achieves by the securitisation is justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties. Permission may only be granted where the institution meets both of the following conditions:
- (a)the institution has adequate internal risk management policies and methodologies to assess the transfer of credit risk;
- (b)the institution has also recognised the transfer of credit risk to third parties in each case for the purposes of the institution’s internal risk management and its internal capital allocation.


**4.** In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, all of the following conditions shall be met:
- (a)the transaction documentation reflects the economic substance of the securitisation;
- (b)the securitisation positions do not constitute payment obligations of the originator institution;
- (c)the underlying exposures are placed beyond the reach of the originator institution and its creditors in a manner that meets the requirement set out in Article 20(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402;
- (d)the originator institution does not retain control over the underlying exposures. It shall be considered that control is retained over the underlying exposures where the originator has the right to repurchase from the transferee the previously transferred exposures in order to realise their benefits or if it is otherwise required to re-assume transferred risk. The originator institution’s retention of servicing rights or obligations in respect of the underlying exposures shall not of itself constitute control of the exposures;
- (e)the securitisation documentation does not contain terms or conditions that:(i)require the originator institution to alter the underlying exposures to improve the average quality of the pool; or(ii)increase the yield payable to holders of positions or otherwise enhance the positions in the securitisation in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;
- (f)where applicable, the transaction documentation makes it clear that the originator or the sponsor may only purchase or repurchase securitisation positions or repurchase, restructure or substitute the underlying exposures beyond their contractual obligations where such arrangements are executed in accordance with prevailing market conditions and the parties to them act in their own interest as free and independent parties (arm’s length);
- (g)where there is a clean-up call option, that option shall also meet all of the following conditions:(i)it can be exercised at the discretion of the originator institution;(ii)it may only be exercised when 10 % or less of the original value of the underlying exposures remains unamortised;(iii)it is not structured to avoid allocating losses to credit enhancement positions or other positions held by investors in the securitisation and is not otherwise structured to provide credit enhancement;
- (h)the originator institution has received an opinion from a qualified legal counsel confirming that the securitisation complies with the conditions set out in point (c) of this paragraph.


**5.** The competent authorities shall inform the EBA of those cases where they have decided that the possible reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts was not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties in accordance with paragraph 2, and the cases where institutions have chosen to apply paragraph 3.


**6.** The EBA shall monitor the range of supervisory practices in relation to the recognition of significant risk transfer in traditional securitisations in accordance with this Article. In particular, the EBA shall review:
- (a)the conditions for the transfer of significant credit risk to third parties in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4;
- (b)the interpretation of "commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties" for the purposes of the competent authorities’ assessment provided for in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 and in paragraph 3;
- (c)the requirements for the competent authorities’ assessment of securitisation transactions in relation to which the originator seeks recognition of significant credit risk transfer to third parties in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3.The EBA shall report its findings to the Commission by 2 January 2021. The Commission may, having taken into account the report from the EBA, adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 462, to supplement this Regulation by further specifying the items listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph.


# Article 245

**Synthetic securitisation**

*Article 245*


**1.** The originator institution of a synthetic securitisation may calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, where relevant, expected loss amounts with respect to the underlying exposures in accordance with Articles 251 and 252, where either of the following conditions is met:
- (a)significant credit risk has been transferred to third parties either through funded or unfunded credit protection;
- (b)the originator institution applies a 1 250 % risk weight to all securitisation positions that it retains in the securitisation or deducts these securitisation positions from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1).


**2.** Significant credit risk shall be considered as transferred in either of the following cases:
- (a)the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the mezzanine securitisation positions held by the originator institution in the securitisation do not exceed 50 % of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of all mezzanine securitisation positions existing in this securitisation;
- (b)the originator institution does not hold more than 20 % of the exposure value of the first loss tranche in the securitisation, provided that both of the following conditions are met:(i)the originator can demonstrate that the exposure value of the first loss tranche exceeds a reasoned estimate of the expected loss on the underlying exposures by a substantial margin;(ii)there are no mezzanine securitisation positions.Where the possible reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts, which the originator institution would achieve by the securitisation, is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, competent authorities may decide on a case-by-case basis that significant credit risk shall not be considered as transferred to third parties.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2, competent authorities may allow originator institutions to recognise significant credit risk transfer in relation to a securitisation where the originator institution demonstrates in each case that the reduction in own funds requirements which the originator achieves by the securitisation is justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties. Permission may only be granted where the institution meets both of the following conditions:
- (a)the institution has adequate internal risk-management policies and methodologies to assess the transfer of risk;
- (b)the institution has also recognised the transfer of credit risk to third parties in each case for the purposes of the institution’s internal risk management and its internal capital allocation.

- (d)the credit protection is enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions;
- (e)where applicable, the transaction documentation makes it clear that the originator or the sponsor may only purchase or repurchase securitisation positions or repurchase, restructure or substitute the underlying exposures beyond their contractual obligations where such arrangements are executed in accordance with prevailing market conditions and the parties to them act in their own interest as free and independent parties (arm’s length);
- (f)where there is a clean-up call option, that option meets all the following conditions:(i)it may be exercised at the discretion of the originator institution;(ii)it may only be exercised when 10 % or less of the original value of the underlying exposures remains unamortised;(iii)it is not structured to avoid allocating losses to credit enhancement positions or other positions held by investors in the securitisation and is not otherwise structured to provide credit enhancement;
- (g)the originator institution has received an opinion from a qualified legal counsel confirming that the securitisation complies with the conditions set out in point (d) of this paragraph;


**5.** The competent authorities shall inform the EBA of the cases where they have decided that the possible reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts was not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties in accordance with paragraph 2, and the cases where institutions have chosen to apply paragraph 3.

- (b)the interpretation of "commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties" for the purposes of the competent authorities’ assessment provided for in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 and in paragraph 3; and
- (c)the requirements for the competent authorities’ assessment of securitisation transactions in relation to which the originator seeks recognition of significant credit risk transfer to third parties in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3.The EBA shall report its findings to the Commission by 2 January 2021. The Commission may, having taken into account the report from the EBA, adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 462, to supplement this Regulation by further specifying the items listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph.


# Article 246

**Operational requirements for early amortisation provisions**

*Article 246*

Where the securitisation includes revolving exposures and early amortisation provisions or similar provisions, significant credit risk shall only be considered transferred by the originator institution where the requirements laid down in Articles 244 and 245 are met and the early amortisation provision, once triggered, does not:
- (a)subordinate the institution’s senior or 
*pari passu* claim on the underlying exposures to the other investors’ claims;
- (b)subordinate further the institution’s claim on the underlying exposures relative to other parties’ claims; or
- (c)otherwise increase the institution’s exposure to losses associated with the underlying revolving exposures.
# Article 247

**Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts**

*Article 247*


**1.** Where an originator institution has transferred significant credit risk associated with the underlying exposures of the securitisation in accordance with Section 2, that institution may:
- (a)in the case of a traditional securitisation, exclude the underlying exposures from its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, as relevant, expected loss amounts;
- (b)in the case of a synthetic securitisation, calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, where relevant, expected loss amounts, with respect to the underlying exposures in accordance with Articles 251 and 252.


**2.** Where the originator institution has decided to apply paragraph 1, it shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts as set out in this Chapter for the positions that it may hold in the securitisation.Where the originator institution has not transferred significant credit risk or has decided not to apply paragraph 1, it shall not be required to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for any position it may have in the securitisation but shall continue including the underlying exposures in its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and, where relevant, expected loss amounts as if they had not been securitised.


**3.** Where there is an exposure to positions in different tranches in a securitisation, the exposure to each tranche shall be considered a separate securitisation position. The providers of credit protection to securitisation positions shall be considered as holding positions in the securitisation. Securitisation positions shall include exposures to a securitisation arising from interest rate or currency derivative contracts that the institution has entered into with the transaction.


**4.** Unless a securitisation position is deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 items pursuant to point (k) of Article 36(1), the risk-weighted exposure amount shall be included in the institution’s total of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(3).


**5.** The risk-weighted exposure amount of a securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the exposure value of the position, calculated as set out in Article 248, by the relevant total risk weight.


**6.** The total risk weight shall be determined as the sum of the risk weight set out in this Chapter and any additional risk weight in accordance with Article 270a.


# Article 248

**Exposure value**

*Article 248*


**1.** The exposure value of a securitisation position shall be calculated as follows:
- (a)the exposure value of an on-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its accounting value remaining after any relevant specific credit risk adjustments on the securitisation position have been applied in accordance with Article 110;
- (b)the exposure value of an off-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its nominal value less any relevant specific credit risk adjustments on the securitisation position in accordance with Article 110, multiplied by the relevant conversion factor as set out in this point. The conversion factor shall be 100 %, except in the case of cash advance facilities. To determine the exposure value of the undrawn portion of the cash advance facilities, a conversion factor of 0 % may be applied to the nominal amount of a liquidity facility that is unconditionally cancellable provided that repayment of draws on the facility are senior to any other claims on the cash flows arising from the underlying exposures and the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that it is applying an appropriately conservative method for measuring the amount of the undrawn portion;
- (c)the exposure value for the counterparty credit risk of a securitisation position that results from a derivative instrument listed in Annex II, shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 6;
- (d)an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position which is assigned 1 250 % risk weight in accordance with Subsection 3 or deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1), the amount of the specific credit risk adjustments on the underlying exposures in accordance with Article 110, and any non-refundable purchase price discounts connected with such underlying exposures to the extent that such discounts have caused the reduction of own funds;
- (e)the exposure value of a synthetic excess spread shall include, as applicable, the following:(i)any income from the securitised exposures already recognised by the originator institution in its income statement under the applicable accounting framework that the originator institution has contractually designated to the transaction as synthetic excess spread and that is still available to absorb losses;(ii)any synthetic excess spread that is contractually designated by the originator institution in any previous periods and that is still available to absorb losses;(iii)any synthetic excess spread that is contractually designated by the originator institution for the current period and that is still available to absorb losses;(iv)any synthetic excess spread contractually designated by the originator institution for future periods.For the purposes of this point, any amount that is provided as collateral or credit enhancement in relation to the synthetic securitisation and that is already subject to an own funds requirement in accordance with this Chapter shall not be included in the exposure value.The EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what constitutes an appropriately conservative method for measuring the amount of the undrawn portion referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph.The EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 January 2019.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**2.** Where an institution has two or more overlapping positions in a securitisation, it shall include only one of the positions in its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts.Where the positions partially overlap, the institution may split the position into two parts and recognise the overlap in relation to one part only in accordance with the first subparagraph. Alternatively, the institution may treat the positions as if they were fully overlapping by expanding for capital calculation purposes the position that produces the higher risk-weighted exposure amounts.The institution may also recognise an overlap between the specific risk own funds requirements for positions in the trading book and the own funds requirements for securitisation positions in the non-trading book, provided that the institution is able to calculate and compare the own funds requirements for the relevant positions.For the purposes of this paragraph, two positions shall be deemed to be overlapping where they are mutually offsetting in such a manner that the institution is able to preclude the losses arising from one position by performing the obligations required under the other position.


**3.** Where point (d) of Article 270c applies to positions in an ABCP, the institution may use the risk weight assigned to a liquidity facility in order to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for the ABCP, provided that the liquidity facility covers 100 % of the ABCP issued by the ABCP programme and the liquidity facility ranks 
*pari passu* with the ABCP in a manner that they form an overlapping position. The institution shall notify the competent authorities where it has applied the provisions laid down in this paragraph. For the purposes of determining the 100 % coverage set out in this paragraph, the institution may take into account other liquidity facilities in the ABCP programme, provided that they form an overlapping position with the ABCP.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how originator institutions are to determine the exposure value referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, taking into account the relevant losses expected to be covered by the synthetic excess spread.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 October 2021.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 249

**Recognition of credit risk mitigation for securitisation positions**

*Article 249*


**1.** An institution may recognise funded or unfunded credit protection with respect to a securitisation position where the requirements for credit risk mitigation laid down in this Chapter and in Chapter 4 are met.


**2.** Eligible funded credit protection shall be limited to financial collateral which is eligible for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under Chapter 2 as laid down under Chapter 4 and recognition of credit risk mitigation shall be subject to compliance with the relevant requirements as laid down under Chapter 4.Eligible unfunded credit protection and unfunded credit protection providers shall be limited to those which are eligible in accordance with Chapter 4 and recognition of credit risk mitigation shall be subject to compliance with the relevant requirements as laid down under Chapter 4.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, the eligible providers of unfunded credit protection listed in point (g) of Article 201(1), shall have been assigned a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI which was credit quality step 2 or above at the time the credit protection was first recognised and is currently credit quality step 3 or above.Institutions which are allowed to apply the IRB Approach to a direct exposure to the protection provider may assess eligibility in accordance with the first subparagraph based on the equivalence of the PD for the protection provider to the PD associated with the credit quality steps referred to in Article 136.


**4.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2, SSPEs shall be eligible protection providers where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the SSPE owns assets that qualify as eligible financial collateral in accordance with Chapter 4;
- (b)the assets referred to in point (a) are not subject to claims or contingent claims ranking ahead or 
*pari passu* with the claim or contingent claim of the institution receiving unfunded credit protection; and
- (c)all the requirements for the recognition of financial collateral set out in Chapter 4 are met.


**5.** For the purposes of paragraph 4, the amount of the protection adjusted for any currency and maturity mismatches (Ga) in accordance with Chapter 4 shall be limited to the volatility adjusted market value of those assets and the risk weight of exposures to the protection provider as specified under the Standardised Approach (g) shall be determined as the weighted-average risk weight that would apply to those assets as financial collateral under the Standardised Approach.


**6.** Where a securitisation position benefits from full credit protection or a partial credit protection on a pro-rata basis, the following requirements shall apply:
- (a)the institution providing credit protection shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for the portion of the securitisation position benefiting from credit protection in accordance with Subsection 3 as if it held that portion of the position directly;
- (b)the institution buying credit protection shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Chapter 4 for the protected portion.


**7.** In all cases not covered by paragraph 6, the following requirements shall apply:
- (a)the institution providing credit protection shall treat the portion of the position benefiting from credit protection as a securitisation position and shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts as if it held that position directly in accordance with Subsection 3, subject to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10;
- (b)the institution buying credit protection shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for the protected portion of the position referred to in point (a) in accordance with Chapter 4. The institution shall treat the portion of the securitisation position not benefiting from credit protection as a separate securitisation position and shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Subsection 3, subject to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10.


**8.** Institutions using the Securitisation Internal Ratings Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) or the Securitisation Standardised Approach (SEC-SA) under Subsection 3 shall determine the attachment point (A) and detachment point (D) separately for each of the positions derived in accordance with paragraph 7 as if these had been issued as separate securitisation positions at the time of origination of the transaction. The value of KIRB or KSA, respectively, shall be calculated taking into account the original pool of exposures underlying the securitisation.


**9.** Institutions using the Securitisation External Ratings Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) under Subsection 3 for the original securitisation position shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for the positions derived in accordance with paragraph 7 as follows:
- (a)where the derived position has the higher seniority, it shall be assigned the risk weight of the original securitisation position;
- (b)where the derived position has the lower seniority, it may be assigned an inferred rating in accordance with Article 263(7). In that case, thickness input T shall only be computed on the basis of the derived position. Where a rating may not be inferred, the institution shall apply the higher of the risk weight resulting from either:(i)applying the SEC-SA in accordance with paragraph 8 and Subsection 3; or(ii)the risk weight of the original securitisation position under the SEC-ERBA.


**10.** The derived position with the lower seniority shall be treated as a non-senior securitisation position even if the original securitisation position prior to protection qualifies as senior.


# Article 250

**Implicit support**

*Article 250*


**1.** A sponsor institution, or an originator institution which in respect of a securitisation has made use of Article 247(1) and (2) in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts or has sold instruments from its trading book to the effect that it is no longer required to hold own funds for the risks of those instruments shall not provide support, directly or indirectly, to the securitisation beyond its contractual obligations with a view to reducing potential or actual losses to investors.


**2.** A transaction shall not be considered as support for the purposes of paragraph 1 where the transaction has been duly taken into account in the assessment of significant credit risk transfer and both parties have executed the transaction acting in their own interest as free and independent parties (arm’s length). For these purposes, the institution shall undertake a full credit review of the transaction and, at a minimum, take into account all of the following items:
- (a)the repurchase price;
- (b)the institution’s capital and liquidity position before and after repurchase;
- (c)the performance of the underlying exposures;
- (d)the performance of the securitisation positions;
- (e)the impact of support on the losses expected to be incurred by the originator relative to investors.


**3.** The originator institution and the sponsor institution shall notify the competent authority of any transaction entered into in relation to the securitisation in accordance with paragraph 2.


**4.** The EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines on what constitutes "arm’s length" for the purposes of this Article and the circumstances under which a transaction is not structured to provide support.


**5.** If an originator institution or a sponsor institution fails to comply with paragraph 1 in respect of a securitisation, the institution shall include all of the underlying exposures of that securitisation in its calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts as if they had not been securitised and disclose:
- (a)that it has provided support to the securitisation in breach of paragraph 1; and
- (b)the impact of the support provided in terms of own funds requirements.


# Article 251

**Originator institutions’ calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts securitised in a synthetic securitisation**

*Article 251*


**1.** For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for the underlying exposures, the originator institution of a synthetic securitisation shall use the calculation methodologies set out in this Section where applicable instead of those set out in Chapter 2. For institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and, where relevant, expected loss amounts with respect to the underlying exposures under Chapter 3, the expected loss amount in respect of such exposures shall be zero.


**2.** The requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply to the entire pool of exposures backing the securitisation. Subject to Article 252, the originator institution shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts with respect to all tranches in the securitisation in accordance with this Section, including the positions in relation to which the institution is able to recognise credit risk mitigation in accordance with Article 249. The risk weight to be applied to positions which benefit from credit risk mitigation may be amended in accordance with Chapter 4.


# Article 252

**Treatment of maturity mismatches in synthetic securitisations**

*Article 252*

For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Article 251, any maturity mismatch between the credit protection by which the transfer of risk is achieved and the underlying exposures shall be calculated as follows:
- (a)the maturity of the underlying exposures shall be taken to be the longest maturity of any of those exposures subject to a maximum of 5 years. The maturity of the credit protection shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 4;
- (b)an originator institution shall ignore any maturity mismatch in calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for securitisation positions subject to a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with this Section. For all other positions, the maturity mismatch treatment set out in Chapter 4 shall be applied in accordance with the following formula:
$$RW
^{*} = RW
_{SP} · 
\left[
\left(t -  t
^{*}\right) / 
\left(T -  t
^{*}\right)\right] + RW
_{Ass} · 
\left[
\left(T -  t\right) / 
\left(T -  t
^{*}\right)\right]$$
where:
- **RW***=risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), point (a);
- **RWAss**=risk-weighted exposure amounts for the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised, calculated on a pro-rata basis;
- **RWSP**=risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated under Article 251 as if there was no maturity mismatch;
- **T**=maturity of the underlying exposures, expressed in years;
- **t**=maturity of credit protection, expressed in years;
- **t***=0,25
# Article 253

**Reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts**

*Article 253*


**1.** Where a securitisation position is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight under this Section, institutions may deduct the exposure value of such position from Common Equity Tier 1 capital in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1) as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts. For that purpose, the calculation of the exposure value may reflect eligible funded credit protection in accordance with Article 249.


**2.** Where an institution makes use of the alternative set out in paragraph 1, it may subtract the amount deducted in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1) from the amount specified in Article 268 as maximum capital requirement that would be calculated in respect of the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised.


# Article 254

**Hierarchy of methods**

*Article 254*


**1.** Institutions shall use one of the methods set out in Subsection 3 to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with the following hierarchy:
- (a)where the conditions set out in Article 258 are met, an institution shall use the SEC-IRBA in accordance with Articles 259 and 260;
- (b)where the SEC-IRBA may not be used, an institution shall use the SEC-SA in accordance with Articles 261 and 262;
- (c)where the SEC-SA may not be used, an institution shall use the SEC-ERBA in accordance with Articles 263 and 264 for rated positions or positions in respect of which an inferred rating may be used.


**2.** For rated positions or positions in respect of which an inferred rating may be used, an institution shall use the SEC-ERBA instead of the SEC-SA in each of the following cases:
- (a)where the application of the SEC-SA would result in a risk weight higher than 25 % for positions qualifying as positions in an STS securitisation;
- (b)where the application of the SEC-SA would result in a risk weight higher than 25 % or the application of the SEC-ERBA would result in a risk weight higher than 75 % for positions not qualifying as positions in an STS securitisation;
- (c)for securitisation transactions backed by pools of auto loans, auto leases and equipment leases.


**3.** In cases not covered by paragraph 2, and by way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, an institution may decide to apply the SEC-ERBA instead of the SEC-SA to all of its rated securitisation positions or positions in respect of which an inferred rating may be used.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, an institution shall notify its decision to the competent authority no later than 17 November 2018.Any subsequent decision to further change the approach applied to all of its rated securitisation positions shall be notified by the institution to its competent authority before the 15th November immediately following that decision.In the absence of any objection by the competent authority by 15 December immediately following the deadline referred to in the second or third subparagraph, as appropriate, the decision notified by the institution shall take effect from 1 January of the following year and shall be valid until a subsequently notified decision comes into effect. An institution shall not use different approaches in the course of the same year.


**4.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, competent authorities may prohibit institutions, on a case by case basis, from applying the SEC-SA when the risk-weighted exposure amount resulting from the application of the SEC-SA is not commensurate to the risks posed to the institution or to financial stability, including but not limited to the credit risk embedded in the exposures underlying the securitisation. In the case of exposures not qualifying as positions in an STS securitisation, particular regard shall be had to securitisations with highly complex and risky features.


**5.** Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, an institution may apply the Internal Assessment Approach to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts in relation to an unrated position in an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction in accordance with Article 266, provided that the conditions set out in Article 265 are met. Where an institution has received permission to apply the Internal Assessment Approach in accordance with Article 265(2), and a specific position in an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction falls within the scope of application covered by such permission, the institution shall apply that approach to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of that position.


**6.** For a position in a re-securitisation, institutions shall apply the SEC-SA in accordance with Article 261, with the modifications set out in Article 269.


**7.** In all other cases, a risk weight of 1 250 % shall be assigned to securitisation positions.


**8.** The competent authorities shall inform the EBA of any notification made pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article. The EBA shall monitor the impact of this Article on capital requirements and the range of supervisory practices in connection with paragraph 4 of this Article, and shall report annually to the Commission on its findings and issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 255

**Determination of KIRB and KSA**

*Article 255*


**1.** Where an institution applies the SEC-IRBA under Subsection 3, the institution shall calculate KIRB in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.


**2.** Institutions shall determine KIRB by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated under Chapter 3 in respect of the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised by 8 % divided by the exposure value of the underlying exposures. KIRB shall be expressed in decimal form between zero and one.


**3.** For KIRB calculation purposes, the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated under Chapter 3 in respect of the underlying exposures shall include:
- (a)the amount of expected losses associated with all the underlying exposures of the securitisation including defaulted underlying exposures that are still part of the pool in accordance with Chapter 3; and
- (b)the amount of unexpected losses associated with all the underlying exposures including defaulted underlying exposures in the pool in accordance with Chapter 3.


**4.** Institutions may calculate KIRB in relation to the underlying exposures of the securitisation in accordance with the provisions set out in Chapter 3 for the calculation of capital requirements for purchased receivables. For these purposes, retail exposures shall be treated as purchased retail receivables and non-retail exposures as purchased corporate receivables.


**5.** Institutions shall calculate KIRB separately for dilution risk in relation to the underlying exposures of a securitisation where dilution risk is material to such exposures.Where losses from dilution and credit risks are treated in an aggregate manner in the securitisation, institutions shall combine the respective KIRB for dilution and credit risk into a single KIRB for the purposes of Subsection 3. The presence of a single reserve fund or overcollateralisation available to cover losses from either credit or dilution risk may be regarded as an indication that these risks are treated in an aggregate manner.Where dilution and credit risk are not treated in an aggregate manner in the securitisation, institutions shall modify the treatment set out in the second subparagraph to combine the respective KIRB for dilution and credit risk in a prudent manner.


**6.** Where an institution applies the SEC-SA under Subsection 3, it shall calculate KSA by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amounts that would be calculated under Chapter 2 in respect of the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised by 8 % divided by the value of the underlying exposures. KSA shall be expressed in decimal form between zero and one.For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall calculate the exposure value of the underlying exposures without netting any specific credit risk adjustments and additional value adjustments in accordance with Articles 34 and 110 and other own funds reductions.


**7.** For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 6, where a securitisation structure involves the use of an SSPE, all the SSPE’s exposures related to the securitisation shall be treated as underlying exposures. Without prejudice to the preceding, the institution may exclude the SSPE’s exposures from the pool of underlying exposures for KIRB or KSA calculation purposes if the risk from the SSPE’s exposures is immaterial or if it does not affect the institution’s securitisation position.In the case of funded synthetic securitisations, any material proceeds from the issuance of credit-linked notes or other funded obligations of the SSPE that serve as collateral for the repayment of the securitisation positions shall be included in the calculation of KIRB or KSA if the credit risk of the collateral is subject to the tranched loss allocation.


**8.** For the purposes of the third subparagraph of paragraph 5 of this Article, the EBA shall issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 on the appropriate methods to combine KIRB for dilution and credit risk where these risks are not treated in an aggregate manner in a securitisation.


**9.** The EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions to allow institutions to calculate KIRB for the pools of underlying exposures in accordance with paragraph 4, in particular with regard to:
- (a)internal credit policy and models for calculating KIRB for securitisations;
- (b)use of different risk factors relating to the pool of underlying exposures and, where sufficient accurate or reliable data on that pool are not available, of proxy data to estimate PD and LGD; and
- (c)due diligence requirements to monitor the actions and policies of sellers of receivables or other originators.The EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 January 2019.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 256

**Determination of attachment point (A) and detachment point (D)**

*Article 256*


**1.** For the purposes of Subsection 3, institutions shall set the attachment point (A) at the threshold at which losses within the pool of underlying exposures would start to be allocated to the relevant securitisation position.The attachment point (A) shall be expressed as a decimal value between zero and one and shall be equal to the greater of zero and the ratio of the outstanding balance of the pool of underlying exposures in the securitisation minus the outstanding balance of all tranches that rank senior or 
*pari passu* to the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position including the exposure itself to the outstanding balance of all the underlying exposures in the securitisation.


**2.** For the purposes of Subsection 3, institutions shall set the detachment point (D) at the threshold at which losses within the pool of underlying exposures would result in a complete loss of principal for the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position.The detachment point (D) shall be expressed as a decimal value between zero and one and shall be equal to the greater of zero and the ratio of the outstanding balance of the pool of underlying exposures in the securitisation minus the outstanding balance of all tranches that rank senior to the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position to the outstanding balance of all the underlying exposures in the securitisation.


**3.** For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall treat overcollateralisation and funded reserve accounts as tranches and the assets comprising such reserve accounts as underlying exposures.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall disregard unfunded reserve accounts and assets that do not provide credit enhancement, such as those that only provide liquidity support, currency or interest rate swaps and cash collateral accounts related to those positions in the securitisation. For funded reserve accounts and assets providing credit enhancement, the institution shall only treat as securitisation positions the parts of those accounts or assets that are loss-absorbing.


**5.** Where two or more positions of the same transaction have different maturities but share pro rata loss allocation, the calculation of the attachment points (A) and the detachment points (D) shall be based on the aggregated outstanding balance of those positions and the resulting attachment points (A) and detachment points (D) shall be the same.


**6.** For the purposes of calculating the attachment points (A) and detachment points (D) of a synthetic securitisation, the originator institution of the securitisation shall treat the exposure value of the securitisation position corresponding to synthetic excess spread referred to in point (e) of Article 248(1) as a tranche, and adjust the attachment points (A) and detachment points (D) of the other tranches it retains by adding that exposure value to the outstanding balance of the pool of underlying exposures in the securitisation. Institutions other than the originator institution shall not make this adjustment.


# Article 257

**Determination of tranche maturity (MT)**

*Article 257*


**1.** For the purposes of Subsection 3 and subject to paragraph 2, institutions may measure the maturity of a tranche (MT) as either:
- (a)the weighted average maturity of the contractual payments due under the tranche in accordance with the following formula:
$$
\sum
_{t} t · CF
_{t} / 
\sum
_{t} CF
_{t},$$
where CFt denotes all contractual payments (principal, interests and fees) payable by the borrower during period t; or
- (b)the final legal maturity of the tranche in accordance with the following formula:
$$M
_{T} =  1 + 
\left(M
_{L} -  1\right) * 80 %,$$
where ML is the final legal maturity of the tranche.


**2.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, the determination of a tranche maturity (MT) shall be subject in all cases to a floor of 1 year and a cap of 5 years.


**3.** Where an institution may become exposed to potential losses from the underlying exposures by virtue of contract, the institution shall determine the maturity of the securitisation position by taking into account the maturity of the contract plus the longest maturity of such underlying exposures. For revolving exposures, the longest contractually possible remaining maturity of the exposure that might be added during the revolving period shall apply.


**4.** The EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area, with particular regard to the application of point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines by 31 December 2019.


# Article 258

**Conditions for the use of the Internal Ratings Based Approach (SEC-IRBA)**

*Article 258*


**1.** Institutions shall use the SEC-IRBA to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts in relation to a securitisation position where the following conditions are met:
- (a)the position is backed by an IRB pool or a mixed pool, provided that, in the latter case, the institution is able to calculate KIRB in accordance with Section 3 on a minimum of 95 % of the underlying exposure amount;
- (b)there is sufficient information available in relation to the underlying exposures of the securitisation for the institution to be able to calculate KIRB; and
- (c)the institution has not been precluded from using the SEC-IRBA in relation to a specified securitisation position in accordance with paragraph 2.


**2.** Competent authorities may on a case-by-case basis preclude the use of the SEC-IRBA where securitisations have highly complex or risky features. For these purposes, the following may be regarded as highly complex or risky features:
- (a)credit enhancement that can be eroded for reasons other than portfolio losses;
- (b)pools of underlying exposures with a high degree of internal correlation as a result of concentrated exposures to single sectors or geographical areas;
- (c)transactions where the repayment of the securitisation positions is highly dependent on risk drivers not reflected in KIRB; or
- (d)highly complex loss allocations between tranches.


# Article 259

**Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the SEC-IRBA**

*Article 259*


**1.** Under the SEC-IRBA, the risk-weighted exposure amount for a securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the exposure value of the position calculated in accordance with Article 248 by the applicable risk weight determined as follows, in all cases subject to a floor of 15 %:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| RW = 1 250 % | when D ≤ KIRB | 
| 
$$RW =  12,5 · K
_{SSFA
\left(K
_{IRB}\right)}$$
 | when A ≥ KIRB | 
| 
$$RW = 
\left[
\left(
\frac{K
_{IRB} -  A}{D -  A}\right) · 12.5\right] + 
\left[
\left(
\frac{D -  K
_{IRB}}{D -  A}\right) · 12.5 · K
_{SSFA
\left(K
_{IRB}\right)}\right]$$
 | when A < KIRB < D | where:
- **KIRB**: is the capital charge of the pool of underlying exposures as defined in Article 255
- **D**: is the detachment point as determined in accordance with Article 256
- **A**: is the attachment point as determined in accordance with Article 256
$$K
_{SSFA
\left(K
_{IRB}\right)} = 
\frac{e
^{a · u} -  e
^{a · l}}{a
\left(u -  l\right)}$$
where:
- **a**=– (1/(p * KIRB))
- **u**=D – KIRB
- **l**=max (A – KIRB; 0)where:
$$p = \max
\left[0,3; 
\left(A +  B
^{*}
\left(1 / N\right) +  C
^{*} K
_{IRB} +  D
^{*}LGD +  E
^{*}M
_{T}\right)\right]$$
where:
- **N**: is the effective number of exposures in the pool of underlying exposures, calculated in accordance with paragraph 4;
- **LGD**: is the exposure-weighted average loss-given-default of the pool of underlying exposures, calculated in accordance with paragraph 5;
- **MT**: is the maturity of the tranche as determined in accordance with Article 257.The parameters A, B, C, D, and E shall be determined according to the following look-up table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | A | B | C | D | E | 
| Non-retail | Senior, granular (N ≥ 25) | 0 | 3,56 | –1,85 | 0,55 | 0,07 | 
| Senior, non-granular (N < 25) | 0,11 | 2,61 | –2,91 | 0,68 | 0,07 | 
| Non-senior, granular (N ≥ 25) | 0,16 | 2,87 | –1,03 | 0,21 | 0,07 | 
| Non-senior, non-granular (N < 25) | 0,22 | 2,35 | –2,46 | 0,48 | 0,07 | 
| Retail | Senior | 0 | 0 | –7,48 | 0,71 | 0,24 | 
| Non-senior | 0 | 0 | –5,78 | 0,55 | 0,27 |


**2.** If the underlying IRB pool comprises both retail and non-retail exposures, the pool shall be divided into one retail and one non-retail subpool and, for each subpool, a separate p-parameter (and the corresponding input parameters N, KIRB and LGD) shall be estimated. Subsequently, a weighted average p-parameter for the transaction shall be calculated on the basis of the p-parameters of each subpool and the nominal size of the exposures in each subpool.


**3.** Where an institution applies the SEC-IRBA to a mixed pool, the calculation of the p-parameter shall be based on the underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach only. The underlying exposures subject to the Standardised Approach shall be ignored for these purposes.


**4.** The effective number of exposures (N) shall be calculated as follows:
$$N = 
\frac{
\left(
\sum
_{i} EAD
_{i}\right)
^{2}}{
\sum
_{i} EAD
^{2}
_{i}}$$
where EADi represents the exposure value associated with the ith exposure in the pool.Multiple exposures to the same obligor shall be consolidated and treated as a single exposure.


**5.** The exposure-weighted average LGD shall be calculated as follows:
$$LGD = 
\frac{
\sum
_{i} LGD
_{i} · EAD
_{i}}{
\sum
_{i} EAD
_{i}}$$
where LGDi represents the average LGD associated with all exposures to the ith obligor.Where credit and dilution risks for purchased receivables are managed in an aggregate manner in a securitisation, the LGD input shall be construed as a weighted average of the LGD for credit risk and 100 % LGD for dilution risk. The weights shall be the stand-alone IRB Approach capital requirements for credit risk and dilution risk, respectively. For these purposes, the presence of a single reserve fund or overcollateralisation available to cover losses from either credit or dilution risk may be regarded as an indication that these risks are managed in an aggregate manner.


**6.** Where the share of the largest underlying exposure in the pool (C1) is no more than 3 %, institutions may use the following simplified method to calculate N and the exposure-weighted average LGDs:
$$N = 
\left(C
_{1} · C
_{m} + 
\left(
\frac{C
_{m} -  C
_{1}}{m -  1}\right) · max
(1 -  m · C
_{1},0)\right)
^{–1}$$
LGD = 0,50where
- **Cm**: denotes the share of the pool corresponding to the sum of the largest m exposures; and
- **m**: is set by the institution.If only C1 is available and this amount is no more than 0,03, then the institution may set LGD as 0,50 and N as 1/C1.


**7.** Where the position is backed by a mixed pool and the institution is able to calculate KIRB on at least 95 % of the underlying exposure amounts in accordance with point (a) of Article 258(1), the institution shall calculate the capital charge for the pool of underlying exposures as:
$$d · K
_{IRB} + 
\left(1 -  d\right) · K
_{SA},$$
whered is the share of the exposure amount of underlying exposures for which the institution can calculate KIRB over the exposure amount of all underlying exposures.


**8.** Where an institution has a securitisation position in the form of a derivative to hedge market risks, including interest rate or currency risks, the institution may attribute to that derivative an inferred risk weight equivalent to the risk weight of the reference position calculated in accordance with this Article.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the reference position shall be the position that is 
*pari passu* in all respects to the derivative or, in the absence of such 
*pari passu* position, the position that is immediately subordinate to the derivative.


# Article 260

**Treatment of STS securitisations under the SEC-IRBA**

*Article 260*

Under the SEC-IRBA, the risk weight for a position in an STS securitisation shall be calculated in accordance with Article 259, subject to the following modifications:risk-weight floor for senior securitisation positions = 10 %
$$p = \max
\left[0,3; 0,5 · 
\left(A +  B · 
\left(1 / N\right) +  C · K
_{IRB} +  D · LGD +  E · M

# Article 261

**Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Standardised Approach (SEC-SA)**

*Article 261*


**1.** Under the SEC-SA, the risk-weighted exposure amount for a position in a securitisation shall be calculated by multiplying the exposure value of the position as calculated in accordance with Article 248 by the applicable risk weight determined as follows, in all cases subject to a floor of 15 %:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| RW = 1 250 % | when D ≤ KA | 
| 
$$RW =  12.5 · K
_{SSFA
\left(K

 | when A ≥ KA | 
| 
$$RW = 
\left[
\left(
\frac{K
_{A} -  A}{D -  A}\right) · 12.5\right] + 
\left[
\left(
\frac{D -  K
_{A}}{D -  A}\right) · 12.5 · K
_{SSFA
\left(K
_{A}\right)}\right]$$
 | when A < KA < D | where:
- **D**: is the detachment point as determined in accordance with Article 256;
- **A**: is the attachment point as determined in accordance with Article 256;
- **KA**: is a parameter calculated in accordance with paragraph 2;
$$K
_{SSFA
\left(K
_{A}\right)} = 
\frac{e
^{a · u} -  e
^{a · l}}{a
\left(u -  l\right)}$$
where:
- **a**=– (1/(p · KA))
- **u**=D – KA
- **l**=max (A – KA; 0)
- **p**=1 for a securitisation exposure that is not a re-securitisation exposure


**2.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, KA shall be calculated as follows:
$$K
_{A} = 
\left(1 -  W\right) · K
_{SA} +  W · 0.5$$
where:KSA is the capital charge of the underlying pool as defined in Article 255;W = ratio of:
- (a)the sum of the nominal amount of underlying exposures in default, to
- (b)the sum of the nominal amount of all underlying exposures.For these purposes, an exposure in default shall mean an underlying exposure which is either: (i) 90 days or more past due; (ii) subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; (iii) subject to foreclosure or similar proceeding; or (iv) in default in accordance with the securitisation documentation.Where an institution does not know the delinquency status for 5 % or less of underlying exposures in the pool, the institution may use the SEC-SA subject to the following adjustment in the calculation KA:
$$K
_{A} = 
\left(
\frac{EAD
_{Subpool 1 where W known}}{EAD Total}CARTPROD K
^{Subpool 1 where W known}
_{A}\right) + 
\frac{EAD
_{Subpool 2 where W unknown}}{EAD Total}$$
Where the institution does not know the delinquency status for more than 5 % of underlying exposures in the pool, the position in the securitisation must be risk-weighted at 1 250 %.


**3.** Where an institution has a securitisation position in the form of a derivative to hedge market risks, including interest rate or currency risks, the institution may attribute to that derivative an inferred risk weight equivalent to the risk weight of the reference position calculated in accordance with this Article.For the purposes of this paragraph, the reference position shall be the position that is 
*pari passu* in all respects to the derivative or, in the absence of such 
*pari passu* position, the position that is immediately subordinate to the derivative.


# Article 262

**Treatment of STS securitisations under the SEC-SA**

*Article 262*

Under the SEC-SA the risk weight for a position in an STS securitisation shall be calculated in accordance with Article 261, subject to the following modifications:
- risk-weight floor for senior securitisation positions = 10 %
- p = 0,5
# Article 263

**Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the External Ratings Based Approach (SEC-ERBA)**

*Article 263*


**1.** Under the SEC-ERBA, the risk-weighted exposure amount for a securitisation position shall be calculated by multiplying the exposure value of the position as calculated in accordance with Article 248 by the applicable risk weight in accordance with this Article.


**2.** For exposures with short-term credit assessments or when a rating based on a short-term credit assessment may be inferred in accordance with paragraph 7, the following risk weights shall apply:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Credit Quality Step | 1 | 2 | 3 | All other ratings | 
| Risk weight | 15 % | 50 % | 100 % | 1 250 % |

**4.** In order to determine the risk weight for tranches with a maturity between 1 and 5 years, institutions shall use linear interpolation between the risk weights applicable for 1 and 5 years maturity respectively in accordance with Table 2.


**5.** In order to account for tranche thickness, institutions shall calculate the risk weight for non-senior tranches as follows:
$$RW = 
\left[RW after adjusting for maturity according to paragraph 4\right] · 
\left[1 - \min

**6.** The risk weights for non-senior tranches resulting from paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be subject to a floor of 15 %. In addition, the resulting risk weights shall be no lower than the risk weight corresponding to a hypothetical senior tranche of the same securitisation with the same credit assessment and maturity.


**7.** For the purposes of using inferred ratings, institutions shall attribute to an unrated position an inferred rating equivalent to the credit assessment of a rated reference position which meets all of the following conditions:
- (a)the reference position ranks 
*pari passu* in all respects to the unrated securitisation position or, in the absence of a 
*pari passu* ranking position, the reference position is immediately subordinate to the unrated position;
- (b)the reference position does not benefit from any third-party guarantees or other credit enhancements that are not available to the unrated position;
- (c)the maturity of the reference position shall be equal to or longer than that of the unrated position in question;
- (d)on an ongoing basis, any inferred rating shall be updated to reflect any changes in the credit assessment of the reference position.


**8.** Where an institution has a securitisation position in the form of a derivative to hedge market risks, including interest rate or currency risks, the institution may attribute to that derivative an inferred risk weight equivalent to the risk weight of the reference position calculated in accordance with this Article.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the reference position shall be the position that is pari passu in all respects to the derivative or, in the absence of such pari passu position, the position that is immediately subordinate to the derivative.

# Article 265

**Scope and operational requirements for the Internal Assessment Approach**

*Article 265*


**1.** Institutions may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for unrated positions in ABCP programmes or ABCP transactions under the Internal Assessment Approach in accordance with Article 266 where the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of this Article are met.Where an institution has received permission to apply the Internal Assessment Approach in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, and a specific position in an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction falls within the scope of application covered by such permission, the institution shall apply that approach to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of that position.


**2.** The competent authorities shall grant institutions permission to apply the Internal Assessment Approach within a clearly defined scope of application where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)all positions in the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme are rated positions;
- (b)the internal assessment of the credit quality of the position reflects the publicly available assessment methodology of one or more ECAIs for the rating of securitisation positions backed by underlying exposures of the type securitised;
- (c)the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme is predominantly issued to third-party investors;
- (d)the institution’s internal assessment process is at least as conservative as the publicly available assessments of those ECAIs which have provided an external rating for the commercial paper issued from the ABCP programme, in particular with regard to stress factors and other relevant quantitative elements;
- (e)the institution’s internal assessment methodology takes into account all relevant publicly available rating methodologies of the ECAIs that rate the commercial paper of the ABCP programme and includes rating grades corresponding to the credit assessments of ECAIs. The institution shall document in its internal records an explanatory statement describing how the requirements set out in this point have been met and shall update such statement on a regular basis;
- (f)the institution uses the internal assessment methodology for internal risk management purposes, including in its decision-making, management information and internal capital allocation processes;
- (g)internal or external auditors, an ECAI, or the institution’s internal credit review or risk management function perform regular reviews of the internal assessment process and the quality of the internal assessments of the credit quality of the institution’s exposures to an ABCP programme or ABCP transaction;
- (h)the institution tracks the performance of its internal ratings over time to evaluate the performance of its internal assessment methodology and makes adjustments, as necessary, to that methodology when the performance of the exposures routinely diverges from that indicated by the internal ratings;
- (i)the ABCP programme includes underwriting and liability management standards in the form of guidelines to the programme administrator on, at least:(i)the asset eligibility criteria, subject to point (j);(ii)the types and monetary value of the exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit enhancements;(iii)the loss distribution between the securitisation positions in the ABCP programme or ABCP transaction;(iv)the legal and economic isolation of the transferred assets from the entity selling the assets;
- (j)the asset eligibility criteria in the ABCP programme provide for, at least:(i)exclusion of the purchase of assets that are significantly past due or defaulted;(ii)limitation of excessive concentration to individual obligor or geographic area; and(iii)limitation of the tenor of the assets to be purchased;
- (k)an analysis of the asset seller’s credit risk and business profile is performed including, at least, an assessment of the seller’s:(i)past and expected future financial performance;(ii)current market position and expected future competitiveness;(iii)leverage, cash flow, interest coverage and debt rating; and(iv)underwriting standards, servicing capabilities, and collection processes;
- (l)the ABCP programme has collection policies and processes that take into account the operational capability and credit quality of the servicer and comprises features that mitigate performance-related risks of the seller and the servicer. For the purposes of this point, performance-related risks may be mitigated through triggers based on the seller or servicer’s current credit quality to prevent commingling of funds in the event of the seller’s or servicer’s default;
- (m)the aggregated estimate of loss on an asset pool that may be purchased under the ABCP programme takes into account all sources of potential risk, such as credit and dilution risk;
- (n)where the seller-provided credit enhancement is sized based only on credit-related losses and dilution risk is material for the particular asset pool, the ABCP programme comprises a separate reserve for dilution risk;
- (o)the size of the required enhancement level in the ABCP programme is calculated taking into account several years of historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions, and the turnover rate of the receivables;
- (p)the ABCP programme comprises structural features in the purchase of exposures in order to mitigate potential credit deterioration of the underlying portfolio. Such features may include wind-down triggers specific to a pool of exposures;
- (q)the institution evaluates the characteristics of the underlying asset pool, such as its weighted-average credit score, and identifies any concentrations to an individual obligor or geographic area and the granularity of the asset pool.


**3.** Where the institution’s internal audit, credit review, or risk management functions perform the review provided for in point (g) of paragraph 2, those functions shall be independent from the institution’s internal functions dealing with ABCP programme business and customer relations.


**4.** Institutions which have received permission to apply the Internal Assessment Approach shall not revert to the use of other methods for positions that fall within scope of application of the Internal Assessment Approach unless both of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the institution has good cause to do so;
- (b)the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority.


# Article 266

**Calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts under the Internal Assessment Approach**

*Article 266*


**1.** Under the Internal Assessment Approach, the institution shall assign the unrated position in the ABCP programme or ABCP transaction to one of the rating grades laid down in point (e) of Article 265(2) on the basis of its internal assessment. The position shall be attributed a derived rating which shall be the same as the credit assessments corresponding to that rating grade as laid down in point (e) of Article 265(2).


**2.** The rating derived in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be at least at the level of investment grade or better at the time it was first assigned and shall be regarded as an eligible credit assessment by an ECAI for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Article 263 or Article 264, as applicable.


# Article 267

**Maximum risk weight for senior securitisation positions: look-through approach**

*Article 267*


**1.** An institution which has knowledge at all times of the composition of the underlying exposures may assign the senior securitisation position a maximum risk weight equal to the exposure-weighted-average risk weight that would be applicable to the underlying exposures as if the underlying exposures had not been securitised.


**2.** In the case of pools of underlying exposures where the institution uses exclusively the Standardised Approach or the IRB Approach, the maximum risk weight of the senior securitisation position shall be equal to the exposure-weighted-average risk weight that would apply to the underlying exposures under Chapter 2 or 3, respectively, as if they had not been securitised.In the case of mixed pools the maximum risk weight shall be calculated as follows:
- (a)where the institution applies the SEC-IRBA, the Standardised Approach portion and the IRB Approach portion of the underlying pool shall each be assigned the corresponding Standardised Approach risk weight and IRB Approach risk weight respectively;
- (b)where the institution applies the SEC-SA or the SEC-ERBA, the maximum risk weight for senior securitisation positions shall be equal to the Standardised Approach weighted-average risk weight of the underlying exposures.


**3.** For the purposes of this Article, the risk weight that would be applicable under the IRB Approach in accordance with Chapter 3 shall include the ratio of:
- (a)expected losses multiplied by 12,5 to
- (b)the exposure value of the underlying exposures.


**4.** Where the maximum risk weight calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 results in a lower risk weight than the risk-weight floors set out in Articles 259 to 264, as applicable, the former shall be used instead.


# Article 268

**Maximum capital requirements**

*Article 268*


**1.** An originator institution, a sponsor institution or other institution using the SEC-IRBA or an originator institution or sponsor institution using the SEC-SA or the SEC-ERBA may apply a maximum capital requirement for the securitisation position it holds equal to the capital requirements that would be calculated under Chapter 2 or 3 in respect of the underlying exposures had they not been securitised. For the purposes of this Article, the IRB Approach capital requirement shall include the amount of the expected losses associated with those exposures calculated under Chapter 3 and that of unexpected losses.


**2.** In the case of mixed pools, the maximum capital requirement shall be determined by calculating the exposure-weighted average of the capital requirements of the IRB Approach and Standardised Approach portions of the underlying exposures in accordance with paragraph 1.


**3.** The maximum capital requirement shall be the result of multiplying the amount calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2 by the largest proportion of interest that the institution holds in the relevant tranches (V), expressed as a percentage and calculated as follows:
- (a)for an institution that has one or more securitisation positions in a single tranche, V shall be equal to the ratio of the nominal amount of the securitisation positions that the institution holds in that given tranche to the nominal amount of the tranche;
- (b)for an institution that has securitisation positions in different tranches, V shall be equal to the maximum proportion of interest across tranches. For these purposes, the proportion of interest for each of the different tranches shall be calculated as set out in point (a).


**4.** When calculating the maximum capital requirement for a securitisation position in accordance with this Article, the entire amount of any gain on sale and credit-enhancing interest-only strips arising from the securitisation transaction shall be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1).


# Article 269

**Re-securitisations**

*Article 269*


**1.** For a position in a re-securitisation, institutions shall apply the SEC-SA in accordance with Article 261, with the following changes:
- (a)W = 0 for any exposure to a securitisation tranche within the pool of underlying exposures;
- (b)p = 1,5;
- (c)the resulting risk weight shall be subject to a risk-weight floor of 100 %.


**2.** KSA for the underlying securitisation exposures shall be calculated in accordance with Subsection 2.


**3.** The maximum capital requirements set out in Subsection 4 shall not be applied to re-securitisation positions.


**4.** Where the pool of underlying exposures consists of a mix of securitisation tranches and other types of assets, the KA parameter shall be determined as the nominal exposure weighted-average of the KA calculated individually for each subset of exposures.


# Article 269a

**Treatment of non-performing exposures (NPE) securitisations**

*Article 269A*


**1.** For the purposes of this Article:
- (a)"NPE securitisation" means an NPE securitisation as defined in point (25) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402;
- (b)"qualifying traditional NPE securitisation" means a traditional NPE securitisation where the non-refundable purchase price discount is at least 50 % of the outstanding amount of the underlying exposures at the time they were transferred to the SSPE.


**2.** The risk weight for a position in an NPE securitisation shall be calculated in accordance with Article 254 or 267. The risk weight shall be subject to a floor of 100 %, except when Article 263 is applied.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall assign a risk weight of 100 % to the senior securitisation position in a qualifying traditional NPE securitisation, except when Article 263 is applied.


**4.** Institutions that apply the IRB Approach to any exposures in the pool of underlying exposures in accordance with Chapter 3 and that are not permitted to use own estimates of LGD and conversion factors for such exposures shall not use the SEC-IRBA for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for a position in an NPE securitisation and shall not apply paragraph 5 or 6.


**5.** For the purposes of Article 268(1), expected losses associated with exposures underlying a qualifying traditional NPE securitisation shall be included after deduction of the non-refundable purchase price discount and, where applicable, any additional specific credit risk adjustments.Institutions shall perform the calculation in accordance with the following formula:

*[Formula: L_2021116EN.01002901.tif]*

  where:
- **CR\max**=the maximum capital requirement in the case of a qualifying traditional NPE securitisation;
- **RWEAIRB**=the sum of risk-weighted exposure amounts of the underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach;
- **ELIRB**=the sum of expected loss amounts of the underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach;
- **NRPPD**=the non-refundable purchase price discount;
- **EVIRB**=the sum of exposure values of the underlying exposures that are subject to the IRB Approach;
- **EVPool**=the sum of exposure values of all underlying exposures in the pool;
- **SCRAIRB**=for originator institutions, the specific credit risk adjustments made by the institution with respect to those underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach only if and to the extent these adjustments exceed the NRPPD; for investor institutions the amount is zero;
- **RWEASA**=the sum of risk-weighted exposure amounts of the underlying exposures subject to the Standardised Approach.


**6.** By way of derogation from paragraph 3 of this Article, where the exposure-weighted average risk weight calculated in accordance with the look-through approach set out in Article 267 is lower than 100 %, institutions may apply the lower risk weight, subject to a 50 % risk-weight floor.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, originator institutions that apply the SEC-IRBA to a position and that are permitted to use own estimates of LGD and conversion factors for all underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach in accordance with Chapter 3, shall deduct the non-refundable purchase price discount and, where applicable, any additional specific credit risk adjustments from the expected losses and exposure values of the underlying exposures associated with a senior position in a qualifying traditional NPE securitisation, in accordance with the following formula:

*[Formula: L_2021116EN.01002902.tif]*

  where:
- **RW\max**=the risk weight, before applying the floor, applicable to a senior position in a qualifying traditional NPE securitisation when the look-through approach is used;
- **RWEAIRB**=the sum of risk-weighted exposure amounts of the underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach;
- **RWEASA**=the sum of risk-weighted exposure amounts of the underlying exposures subject to the Standardised Approach;
- **ELIRB**=the sum of expected loss amounts of the underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach;
- **NRPPD**=the non-refundable purchase price discount;
- **EVIRB**=the sum of exposure values of the underlying exposures that are subject to the IRB Approach;
- **EVpool**=the sum of exposure values of all underlying exposures in the pool;
- **EVSA**=the sum of exposure values of the underlying exposures that are subject to the Standardised Approach;
- **SCRAIRB**=the specific credit risk adjustments made by the originator institution with respect to the underlying exposures subject to the IRB Approach only if and to the extent these adjustments exceed the NRPPD.


**7.** For the purposes of this Article, the non-refundable purchase price discount shall be calculated by subtracting the amount referred to in point (b) from the amount referred to in point (a):
- (a)the outstanding amount of the underlying exposures of the NPE securitisation at the time those exposures were transferred to the SSPE;
- (b)the sum of the following:(i)the initial sale price of the tranches or, where applicable, parts of the tranches of the NPE securitisation sold to third party investors; and(ii)the outstanding amount, at the time the underlying exposures were transferred to the SSPE, of the tranches or, where applicable, parts of tranches of that securitisation held by the originator.For the purposes of paragraphs 5 and 6, throughout the life of the transaction, the calculation of the non-refundable purchase price discount shall be adjusted downwards taking into account the realised losses. Any reduction in the outstanding amount of the underlying exposures resulting from realised losses shall reduce the non-refundable purchase price discount, subject to a floor of zero.Where a discount is structured in such a way that it can be refunded in whole or in part to the originator, such discount shall not count as a non-refundable purchase price discount for the purposes of this Article.


# Article 270

**Senior positions in STS on-balance sheet securitisations**

*Article 270*


**1.** An originator institution may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts of a securitisation position in an STS on-balance sheet securitisation as referred to in Article 26a(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 in accordance with Article 260, 262 or 264 of this Regulation, as applicable, where that position meets both of the following conditions:
- (a)the securitisation meets the requirements set out in Article 243(2);
- (b)the position qualifies as the senior securitisation position.


**2.** EBA shall monitor the application of paragraph 1 in particular with regard to:
- (a)the market volume and market share of STS on-balance sheet securitisations in respect of which the originator institution applies paragraph 1, across different asset classes;
- (b)the observed allocation of losses to the senior tranche and to other tranches of STS on-balance sheet securitisations, where the originator institution applies paragraph 1 in respect of the senior position held in such securitisations;
- (c)the impact of the application of paragraph 1 on the leverage of institutions;
- (d)the impact of the use of STS on-balance sheet securitisations in respect of which the originator institution applies paragraph 1 on the issuance of capital instruments by the respective originator institutions.


**3.** EBA shall submit a report on its findings to the Commission by 10 April 2023.


**4.** By 10 October 2023, the Commission shall, on the basis of the report referred to in paragraph 3, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, on the application of this Article with particular regard to the risk of excessive leverage resulting from the use of STS on-balance sheet securitisations qualifying for the treatment in accordance with paragraph 1 and to the potential substitution of the issuance of capital instruments by originator institutions through that use. That report shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal.


# Article 270a

**Additional risk weight**

*Article 270A*


**1.** Where an institution does not meet the requirements in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 in any material respect by reason of negligence or omission by the institution, the competent authorities shall impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight, capped at 1 250 %, which shall apply to the relevant securitisation positions in the manner specified in Article 247(6) or Article 337(3) of this Regulation respectively. The additional risk weight shall progressively increase with each subsequent infringement of the due diligence and risk management provisions. The competent authorities shall take into account the exemptions for certain securitisations provided for in Article 6(5)) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 by reducing the risk weight they would otherwise impose under this Article in respect of a securitisation to which Article 6(5) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 applies.


**2.** The EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to facilitate the convergence of supervisory practices with regard to the implementation of paragraph 1, including the measures to be taken in the case of breach of the due diligence and risk management obligations. The EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 270b

**Use of credit assessments by ECAIs**

*Article 270B*

Institutions may use only credit assessments to determine the risk weight of a securitisation position in accordance with this Chapter where the credit assessment has been issued or has been endorsed by an ECAI in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.
# Article 270c

**Requirements to be met by the credit assessments of ECAIs**

*Article 270C*

For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Section 3, institutions shall only use a credit assessment of an ECAI where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)there is no mismatch between the types of payments reflected in the credit assessment and the types of payments to which the institution is entitled under the contract giving rise to the securitisation position in question;
- (b)the ECAI publishes the credit assessments and information on loss and cash-flow analysis, sensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying ratings assumptions, including the performance of underlying exposures, and on the procedures, methodologies, assumptions, and key elements underpinning the credit assessments in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009. For the purposes of this point, information shall be considered as publicly available where it is published in accessible format. Information that is made available only to a limited number of entities shall not be considered as publicly available;
- (c)the credit assessments are included in the ECAI’s transition matrix;
- (d)the credit assessments are not based or partly based on unfunded support provided by the institution itself. Where a position is based or partly based on unfunded support, the institution shall consider that position as if it were unrated for the purposes of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for this position in accordance with Section 3;
- (e)the ECAI has committed to publishing explanations on how the performance of underlying exposures affects the credit assessment.
# Article 270d

**Use of credit assessments**

*Article 270D*


**1.** An institution may decide to nominate one or more ECAIs the credit assessments of which shall be used in the calculation of its risk-weighted exposure amounts under this Chapter (a "nominated ECAI").


**2.** An institution shall use the credit assessments of its securitisation positions in a consistent and non-selective manner and, for these purposes, shall comply with the following requirements:
- (a)an institution shall not use an ECAI’s credit assessments for its positions in some tranches and another ECAI’s credit assessments for its positions in other tranches within the same securitisation that may or may not be rated by the first ECAI;
- (b)where a position has two credit assessments by nominated ECAIs, the institution shall use the less favourable credit assessment;
- (c)where a position has three or more credit assessments by nominated ECAIs, the two most favourable credit assessments shall be used. Where the two most favourable assessments are different, the less favourable of the two shall be used;
- (d)an institution shall not actively solicit the withdrawal of less favourable ratings.


**3.** Where the exposures underlying a securitisation benefit from full or partial eligible credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4, and the effect of such protection has been reflected in the credit assessment of a securitisation position by a nominated ECAI, the institution shall use the risk weight associated with that credit assessment. Where the credit protection referred to in this paragraph is not eligible under Chapter 4, the credit assessment shall not be recognised and the securitisation position shall be treated as unrated.


**4.** Where a securitisation position benefits from eligible credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4 and the effect of such protection has been reflected in its credit assessment by a nominated ECAI, the institution shall treat the securitisation position as if it were unrated and calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Chapter 4.


# Article 270e

**Securitisation mapping**

*Article 270E*

The EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to map in an objective and consistent manner the credit quality steps set out in this Chapter relative to the relevant credit assessments of all ECAIs. For the purposes of this Article, the EBA shall in particular:
- (a)differentiate between the relative degrees of risk expressed by each assessment;
- (b)consider quantitative factors, such as default or loss rates and the historical performance of credit assessments of each ECAI across different asset classes;
- (c)consider qualitative factors such as the range of transactions assessed by the ECAI, its methodology and the meaning of its credit assessments in particular whether such assessments take into account expected loss or first Euro loss, and timely payment of interests or ultimate payment of interests;
- (d)seek to ensure that securitisation positions to which the same risk weight is applied on the basis of the credit assessments of ECAIs are subject to equivalent degrees of credit risk.The EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 July 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

**Definitions**

*Article 272*

For the purposes of this Chapter and of Title VI of this Part, the following definitions shall apply:
- General terms(1)"counterparty credit risk" or "CCR" means the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows;
- Transaction types(2)"long settlement transactions" means transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date specified by contract that is later than the market standard for this particular type of transaction or five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction, whichever is earlier;(3)"margin lending transactions" means transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that are secured by collateral in the form of securities;
- Netting set, hedging sets, and related terms(4)"netting set" means a group of transactions between an institution and a single counterparty that is subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recognised under Section 7 and Chapter 4.Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement which is recognised under Section 7 shall be treated as its own netting set for the purposes of this Chapter.Under the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6, all netting sets with a single counterparty may be treated as a single netting set if negative simulated market values of the individual netting sets are set to 0 in the estimation of expected exposure (hereinafter referred to as "EE");(5)"risk position" means a risk number that is assigned to a transaction under the Standardised Method set out in Section5 following a predetermined algorithm;(6)"hedging set" means a group of transactions within a single netting set for which full or partial offsetting is allowed for determining the potential future exposure under the methods set out in Section 3 or 4 of this Chapter;(7)"margin agreement" means an agreement or provisions of an agreement under which one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an exposure of that second counterparty to the first counterparty exceeds a specified level;(7a)"one way margin agreement" means a margin agreement under which an institution is required to post variation margin to a counterparty but is not entitled to receive variation margin from that counterparty or vice-versa;(8)"margin threshold" means the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding before one party has the right to call for collateral;(9)"margin period of risk" means the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterparty until the transactions are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged;(10)"effective maturity" under the Internal Model Method for a netting set with maturity greater than one year means the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate of return, divided by the sum of expected exposure over one year in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate.This effective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year;(11)"cross-product netting" means the inclusion of transactions of different product categories within the same netting set pursuant to the cross-product netting rules set out in this Chapter;(12)"current market value" or "CMV" means the net market value of all the transactions within a netting set gross of any collateral held or posted where positive and negative market values are netted in computing the CMV;(12a)"net independent collateral amount" or "NICA" means the sum of the volatility-adjusted value of net collateral received or posted, as applicable, to the netting set other than variation margin;
- Distributions(13)"distribution of market values" means the forecast of the probability distribution of net market values of transactions within a netting set for a future date (the forecasting horizon), given the realised market value of those transactions at the date of the forecast;(14)"distribution of exposures" means the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero;(15)"risk-neutral distribution" means a distribution of market values or exposures over a future time period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities;(16)"actual distribution" means a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time period where the distribution is calculated using historic or realised values such as volatilities calculated using past price or rate changes;

# Article 273

**Methods for calculating the exposure value**

*Article 273*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the exposure value for the contracts listed in Annex II and for credit derivatives, with the exception of the credit derivatives referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5 of this Article, on the basis of one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 in accordance with this Article.An institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a(1) shall not use the method set out in Section 4. An institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a(2) shall not use the method set out in Section 5.Institutions may use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis within a group. A single institution shall not use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis.


**2.** Where permitted by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1) and (2), an institution may determine the exposure value for the following items using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6:
- (a)the contracts listed in Annex II;
- (b)repurchase transactions;
- (c)securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions;
- (d)margin lending transactions;
- (e)long settlement transactions.


**3.** When an institution purchases protection through a credit derivative against a non-trading book exposure or against a counterparty risk exposure, it may calculate its own funds requirement for the hedged exposure in accordance with either of the following:
- (a)Articles 233 to 236;
- (b)in accordance with Article 183, where permission has been granted in accordance with Article 143.The exposure value for CCR for those credit derivatives shall be zero, unless an institution applies the approach in point (h)(ii) of Article 299(2).


**4.** Notwithstanding paragraph 3, an institution may choose consistently to include for the purposes of calculating own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk all credit derivatives not included in the trading book and purchased as protection against a non-trading book exposure or against a counterparty credit risk exposure where the credit protection is recognised under this Regulation.


**5.** Where credit default swaps sold by an institution are treated by an institution as credit protection provided by that institution and are subject to own funds requirement for credit risk of the underlying for the full notional amount, their exposure value for the purposes of CCR in the non-trading book shall be zero.


**6.** Under the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, the exposure value for a given counterparty shall be equal to the sum of the exposure values calculated for each netting set with that counterparty.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, where one margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets with that counterparty and the institution is using one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 to calculate the exposure value of those netting sets, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant Section.For a given counterparty, the exposure value for a given netting set of OTC derivative instruments listed in Annex II calculated in accordance with this Chapter shall be the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of exposure values across all netting sets with the counterparty and the sum of credit valuation adjustments for that counterparty being recognised by the institution as an incurred write-down. The credit valuation adjustments shall be calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit value adjustment attributed to the own credit risk of the firm that has been already excluded from own funds in accordance with point (c) of Article 33(1).


**7.** In calculating the exposure value in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5, institutions may treat two OTC derivative contracts included in the same netting agreement that are perfectly matching as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equal to zero.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, two OTC derivative contracts are perfectly matching when they meet all the following conditions:
- (a)their risk positions are opposite;
- (b)their features, with the exception of the trade date, are identical;
- (c)their cash flows fully offset each other.


**8.** Institutions shall determine the exposure value for exposures arising from long settlement transactions by any of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, regardless of which method the institution has chosen for treating OTC derivatives and repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, and margin lending transactions. In calculating the own funds requirements for long settlement transactions, an institution that uses the approach set out in Chapter 3 may assign the risk weights under the approach set out in Chapter 2 on a permanent basis and irrespective of the materiality of those positions.


**9.** For the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, institutions shall treat transactions where Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified in accordance with Article 291(2), (4), (5), and (6).


# Article 273a

- (a)10 % of the institution's total assets;
- (b)EUR 300 million.


**2.** An institution may calculate the exposure value of its derivative positions in accordance with the method set out in Section 5, provided that the size of its on- and off-balance-sheet derivative business is equal to or less than both of the following thresholds on the basis of an assessment carried out on a monthly basis using the data as of the last day of the month:
- (a)5 % of the institution's total assets;
- (b)EUR 100 million.

- (b)the absolute value of the aggregated long position shall be summed with the absolute value of the aggregated short position;
- (c)all derivative positions shall be included, except credit derivatives that are recognised as internal hedges against non-trading book credit risk exposures.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the meaning of long and short positions is the same as that set out in Article 94(3).For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the value of the aggregated long (short) position shall be equal to the sum of the values of the individual long (short) positions included in the calculation in accordance with point (c).


**4.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1 or 2, as applicable, where the derivative business on a consolidated basis does not exceed the thresholds set out in paragraph 1 or 2, as applicable, an institution which is included in the consolidation and which would have to apply the method set out in Section 3 or 4 because it exceeds those thresholds on an individual basis, may, subject to the approval of competent authorities, instead choose to apply the method that would apply on a consolidated basis.


**5.** Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the methods set out in Section 4 or 5 that they use, or cease to use, as applicable, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions.


**6.** Institutions shall not enter into a derivative transaction or buy or sell a derivative instrument for the sole purpose of complying with any of the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 during the monthly assessment.


# Article 273b

- (b)the institution does not meet the conditions set out in point (a) of Article 273a(1) or (2), as applicable, or the conditions set out in point (b) of Article 273a(1) or (2), as applicable, for more than six of the preceding 12 months.


**3.** Institutions that have ceased to calculate the exposure values of their derivative positions in accordance with Section 4 or 5 and to calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 385, as applicable, shall only be permitted to resume calculating the exposure value of their derivative positions as set out in Section 4 or 5 and the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 385 where they demonstrate to the competent authority that all of the conditions set out in Article 273a(1) or (2), have been met for an uninterrupted period of one year.


# Article 274

**Exposure value**

*Article 274*


**1.** An institution may calculate a single exposure value at netting set level for all the transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the netting agreement belongs to one of the types of contractual netting agreements referred to in Article 295;
- (b)the netting agreement has been recognised by competent authorities in accordance with Article 296;
- (c)the institution has fulfilled the obligations laid down in Article 297 in respect of the netting agreement.Where any of the conditions set out in the first subparagraph are not met, the institution shall treat each transaction as if it was its own netting set.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a netting set under the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk as follows:
- Exposure value = α · (RC + PFE)where:
- **RC**=the replacement cost calculated in accordance with Article 275; and
- **PFE**=the potential future exposure calculated in accordance with Article 278;
- **α**=1,4.


**3.** The exposure value of a netting set that is subject to a contractual margin agreement shall be capped at the exposure value of the same netting set not subject to any form of margin agreement.


**4.** Where multiple margin agreements apply to the same netting set, or the same netting set includes both transactions subject to a margin agreement and transactions not subject to a margin agreement, an institution shall calculate its exposure value as follows:
- (a)the institution shall establish the hypothetical sub-netting sets concerned, composed of transactions included in the netting set, as follows:(i)all transactions subject to a margin agreement and to the same margin period of risk as determined in accordance with Article 285(2) to (5), shall be allocated to the same sub-netting set;(ii)all transactions not subject to a margin agreement shall be allocated to the same sub-netting set, distinct from the sub-netting sets established in accordance with point (i) of this paragraph;
- (b)the institution shall calculate the replacement cost of the netting set in accordance with Article 275(2), taking into account all transactions within the netting set, whether or not subject to a margin agreement, and apply all of the following:(i)CMV shall be calculated for all transactions within a netting set gross of any collateral held or posted where positive and negative market values are netted in computing the CMV;(ii)NICA, VM, TH, and MTA, where applicable, shall be calculated separately as the sum across the same inputs applicable to each individual margin agreement of the netting set;

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.010401.fmx.tif]*

  shall be calculated in accordance with Article 278, separately for each hypothetical sub-netting set referred to in point (a) of this paragraph.


**5.** Institutions may set to zero the exposure value of a netting set that satisfies all the following conditions:
- (a)the netting set is solely composed of sold options;
- (b)the current market value of the netting set is at all times negative;
- (c)the premium of all the options included in the netting set has been received upfront by the institution to guarantee the performance of the contracts;
- (d)the netting set is not subject to any margin agreement.


**6.** In a netting set, institutions shall replace a transaction which is a finite linear combination of bought or sold call or put options with all the single options that form that linear combination, taken as an individual transaction, for the purpose of calculating the exposure value of the netting set in accordance with this Section. Each such combination of options shall be treated as an individual transaction in the netting set in which the combination is included for the purpose of calculating the exposure value.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, institutions shall replace a vanilla digital option the strike of which equals K with the relevant collar combination of two sold and bought vanilla call or put options that meet the following requirements:
- (a)the two options of the collar combination have:(i)the same expiry date and the same spot or forward price of the underlying instrument as the vanilla digital option;(ii)strikes equal to 0,95·K and 1,05·K respectively;
- (b)the collar combination replicates exactly the vanilla digital option payoff outside the range between the two strikes referred to in point (a).The risk position of the two options of the collar combination referred to in the second subparagraph shall be calculated separately in accordance with Article 279.


**7.** The exposure value of a credit derivative transaction representing a long position in the underlying may be capped to the amount of outstanding unpaid premium provided it is treated as its own netting set that is not subject to a margin agreement.


# Article 275

**Replacement cost**

*Article 275*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the replacement cost RC for netting sets that are not subject to a margin agreement, in accordance with the following formula:
- RC = max{CMV – NICA, 0}


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the replacement cost for single netting sets that are subject to a margin agreement in accordance with the following formula:
- RC = max{CMV – VM – NICA, TH + MTA – NICA, 0}where:
- **RC**=the replacement cost;
- **VM**=the volatility-adjusted value of the net variation margin received or posted, as applicable, to the netting set on a regular basis to mitigate changes in the netting set's CMV;
- **TH**=the margin threshold applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement below which the institution cannot call for collateral; and
- **MTA**=the minimum transfer amount applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement.


**3.** Institutions shall calculate the replacement cost for multiple netting sets that are subject to the same margin agreement in accordance with the following formula:
$$RC = \max
(
\sum
_{i}\max
(CMV
_{i}, 0) - \max
(VM
_{MA} + NICA
_{MA}, 0), 0) + \max
(
\sum
_{i}\min
(CMV
_{i}, 0) - \min
(VM
_{MA} + NICA
_{MA}, 0), 0)$$
where:
- **RC**=the replacement cost;
- **i**=the index that denotes the netting sets that are subject to the single margin agreement;
- **CMVi**=the CMV of netting set i;
- **VMMA**=the sum of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral received or posted, as applicable, to multiple netting sets on a regular basis to mitigate changes in their CMV; and
- **NICAMA**=the sum of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral received or posted, as applicable, to multiple netting sets other than VMMA.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, NICAMA may be calculated at trade level, at netting set level or at the level of all the netting sets to which the margin agreement applies depending on the level at which the margin agreement applies.


# Article 276

**Recognition and treatment of collateral**

*Article 276*


**1.** For the purposes of this Section, institutions shall calculate the collateral amounts of VM, VMMA, NICA and NICAMA, by applying all the following requirements:
- (a)where all the transactions included in a netting set belong to the trading book, only collateral that is eligible under Articles 197 and 299 shall be recognised;
- (b)where a netting set contains at least one transaction that belongs to the non-trading book, only collateral that is eligible under Article 197 shall be recognised;
- (c)collateral received from a counterparty shall be recognised with a positive sign and collateral posted to a counterparty shall be recognised with a negative sign;
- (d)the volatility-adjusted value of any type of collateral received or posted shall be calculated in accordance with Article 223;
- (e)the same collateral item shall not be included in both VM and NICA at the same time;
- (f)the same collateral item shall not be included in both VMMA and NICAMA at the same time;
- (g)any collateral posted to the counterparty that is segregated from the assets of that counterparty and, as a result of that segregation, is bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of that counterparty shall not be recognised in the calculation of NICA and NICAMA.


**2.** For the calculation of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral posted referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall replace the formula set out in Article 223(2) with the following formula:
- CVA = C · (1 + HC + Hfx)where:CVA = the volatility-adjusted value of collateral posted; andC = the collateral;Hc and Hfx are defined in accordance with Article 223(2).


**3.** For the purposes of point (d) of paragraph 1, institutions shall set the liquidation period relevant for the calculation of the volatility-adjusted value of any collateral received or posted in accordance with one of the following time horizons:
- (a)one year for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(1);
- (b)the margin period of risk determined in accordance with point (b) of Article 279c(1) for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(2) and (3).


# Article 277

**Mapping of transactions to risk categories**

*Article 277*


**1.** Institutions shall map each transaction of a netting set to one of the following risk categories to determine the potential future exposure of the netting set referred to in Article 278:
- (a)interest rate risk;
- (b)foreign exchange risk;
- (c)credit risk;
- (d)equity risk;
- (e)commodity risk;
- (f)other risks.


**2.** Institutions shall conduct the mapping referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of the primary risk driver of a derivative transaction. The primary risk driver shall be the only material risk driver of a derivative transaction.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2, institutions shall map derivative transactions that have more than one material risk driver to more than one risk category. Where all the material risk drivers of one of those transactions belong to the same risk category, institutions shall only be required to map that transaction once to that risk category on the basis of the most material of those risk drivers. Where the material risk drivers of one of those transactions belong to different risk categories, institutions shall map that transaction once to each risk category for which the transaction has at least one material risk driver, on the basis of the most material of the risk drivers in that risk category.


**4.** Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, when mapping transactions to the risk categories listed in paragraph 1, institutions shall apply the following requirements:
- (a)where the primary risk driver of a transaction, or the most material risk driver in a given risk category for transactions referred to in paragraph 3, is an inflation variable, institutions shall map the transaction to the interest rate risk category;
- (b)where the primary risk driver of a transaction, or the most material risk driver in a given risk category for transactions referred to in paragraph 3, is a climatic conditions variable, institutions shall map the transaction to the commodity risk category.


**5.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)the method for identifying transactions with only one material risk driver;
- (b)the method for identifying transactions with more than one material risk driver and for identifying the most material of those risk drivers for the purposes of paragraph 3.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

**Hedging sets**

*Article 277A*


**1.** Institutions shall establish the relevant hedging sets for each risk category of a netting set and assign each transaction to those hedging sets as follows:
- (a)transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is denominated in the same currency;
- (b)transactions mapped to the foreign exchange risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is based on the same currency pair;
- (c)all the transactions mapped to the credit risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set;
- (d)all the transactions mapped to the equity risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set;
- (e)transactions mapped to the commodity risk category shall be assigned to one of the following hedging sets on the basis of the nature of their primary risk driver or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3):(i)energy;(ii)metals;(iii)agricultural goods;(iv)other commodities;(v)climatic conditions;
- (f)transactions mapped to the other risks category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is identical.For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category that have an inflation variable as the primary risk driver shall be assigned to separate hedging sets, other than the hedging sets established for transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category that do not have an inflation variable as the primary risk driver. Those transactions shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is denominated in the same currency.


**2.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall establish separate individual hedging sets in each risk category for the following transactions:
- (a)transactions for which the primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is either the market implied volatility or the realised volatility of a risk driver or the correlation between two risk drivers;
- (b)transactions for which the primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is the difference between two risk drivers mapped to the same risk category or transactions that consist of two payment legs denominated in the same currency and for which a risk driver from the same risk category of the primary risk driver is contained in the other payment leg than the one containing the primary risk driver.For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assign transactions to the same hedging set of the relevant risk category only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is identical.For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, institutions shall assign transactions to the same hedging set of the relevant risk category only where the pair of risk drivers in those transactions as referred to therein is identical and the two risk drivers contained in this pair are positively correlated. Otherwise, institutions shall assign transactions referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph to one of the hedging sets established in accordance with paragraph 1, on the basis of only one of the two risk drivers referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), of this paragraph, institutions shall assign transactions to a separate hedging set of the relevant risk category following the same hedging set construction set out in paragraph 1.


**3.** Institutions shall make available upon request by the competent authorities the number of hedging sets established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article for each risk category, with the primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), or the pair of risk drivers of each of those hedging sets and with the number of transactions in each of those hedging sets.


# Article 278

**Potential future exposure**

*Article 278*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the potential future exposure of a netting set as follows:
$$PFE = multiplier \times 
\sum
_{a}AddOn
^{
\left(a\right)}$$
where:
- **PFE**=the potential future exposure;
- **a**=the index that denotes the risk categories included in the calculation of the potential future exposure of the netting set;
- **AddOn(a)**=the add-on for risk category a calculated in accordance with Articles 280a to 280f, as applicable; and

**Calculation of the risk position**

*Article 279*

For the purpose of calculating the risk category add-ons referred to in Articles 280a to 280f, institutions shall calculate the risk position of each transaction of a netting set as follows:
- RiskPosition = δ · AdjNot · MFwhere:
- **δ**=the supervisory delta of the transaction calculated in accordance with the formula laid down in Article 279a;
- **AdjNot**=the adjusted notional amount of the transaction calculated in accordance with Article 279b; and

# Article 279a

**Supervisory delta**

*Article 279A*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the supervisory delta as follows:
- (a)for call and put options that entitle the option buyer to purchase or sell an underlying instrument at a positive price on a single or multiple dates in the future, except where those options are mapped to the interest rate risk or commodity risk category, institutions shall use the following formula:
$$δ = sign \times N 
\left(type \times 
\frac{ln
\left(P / K\right) + 0,5 \times σ
^{2} \times T}{σ \times T}\right)$$
where:
- **δ**=the supervisory delta;
- **sign**=– 1 where the transaction is a sold call option or a bought put option;
- **sign**=+ 1 where the transaction is a bought call option or sold put option;
- **type**=– 1 where the transaction is a put option;
- **type**=+ 1 where the transaction is a call option;
- **N(x)**=the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable meaning the probability that a normal random variable with mean zero and variance of one is less than or equal to x;
- **P**=the spot or forward price of the underlying instrument of the option; for options the cash flows of which depend on an average value of the price of the underlying instrument, P shall be equal to the average value at the calculation date;
- **K**=the strike price of the option;
- **T**=the period between the expiry date of the option (Texp) and the reporting date; for options which can be exercised at one future date only, Texp is equal to that date; for options which can be exercised at multiple future dates, Texp is equal to the latest of those dates; T shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention; and
- **σ**=the supervisory volatility of the option determined in accordance with Table 1 on the basis of the risk category of the transaction and the nature of the underlying instrument of the option.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk category | Underlying instrument | Supervisory volatility | 
| Foreign exchange | All | 15 % | 
| Credit | Single-name instrument | 100 % | 
| Multiple-names instrument | 80 % | 
| Equity | Single-name instrument | 120 % | 
| Multiple-names instrument | 75 % | 
| Commodity | Electricity | 150 % | 
| Other commodities (excluding electricity) | 70 % | 
| Others | All | 150 % | Institutions using the forward price of the underlying instrument of an option shall ensure that:(i)the forward price is consistent with the characteristics of the option;(ii)the forward price is calculated using a relevant interest rate prevailing at the reporting date;(iii)the forward price integrates the expected cash flows of the underlying instrument before the expiry of the option;
- (b)for tranches of a synthetic securitisation and a nth-to-default credit derivative, institutions shall use the following formula:
$$δ = sign \times 
\frac{15}{
\left(1 + 14 \times A\right) \times 
\left(1 + 14 \times D\right)}$$
where:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | 
| --- | --- | --- |

- **D**=the detachment point of the tranche; for a nth-to-default credit derivative transaction based on reference entities k, D = n/k;
- (c)for transactions not referred to in point (a) or (b), institutions shall use the following supervisory delta:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| δ = |  | + 1 if the transaction is a long position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category | 
| – 1 if the transaction is a short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category |


**2.** For the purposes of this Section, a long position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3) means that the market value of the transaction increases when the value of that risk driver increases and a short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3) means that the market value of the transaction decreases when the value of that risk driver increases.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)in accordance with international regulatory developments, the formulae that institutions shall use to calculate the supervisory delta of call and put options mapped to the interest rate risk or commodity risk category compatible with market conditions in which interest rates or commodity prices may be negative and the supervisory volatility that is suitable for those formulae;
- (b)the method for determining whether a transaction is a long or short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3).EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 279b

**Adjusted notional amount**

*Article 279B*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as follows:
- (a)for transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category or the credit risk category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as the product of the notional amount of the derivative contract and the supervisory duration factor, which shall be calculated as follows:

*[Formula: L_2021398EN.01003701.tif]*

  where:
- **R**=the supervisory discount rate; R = 5 %;
- **S**=the period between the start date of a transaction and the reporting date, which shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention;
- **E**=the period between the end date of a transaction and the reporting date, which shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention; and OneBusinessYear = one year expressed in business days using the relevant business day convention.The start date of a transaction is the earliest date at which at least a contractual payment under the transaction, to or from the institution, is either fixed or exchanged, other than payments related to the exchange of collateral in a margin agreement. Where the transaction has already been fixing or making payments at the reporting date, the start date of a transaction shall be equal to 0.Where a transaction involves one or more contractual future dates on which the institution or the counterparty may decide to terminate the transaction prior to its contractual maturity, the start date of a transaction shall be equal to the earliest of the following:(i)the date or the earliest of the multiple future dates at which the institution or the counterparty may decide to terminate the transaction earlier than its contractual maturity;(ii)the date at which a transaction starts fixing or making payments, other than payments related to the exchange of collateral in a margin agreement.Where a transaction has a financial instrument as the underlying instrument that may give rise to contractual obligations additional to those of the transaction, the start date of a transaction shall be determined on the basis of the earliest date at which the underlying instrument starts fixing or making payments.The end date of a transaction is the latest date at which a contractual payment under the transaction, to or from the institution, is or may be exchanged.Where a transaction has a financial instrument as an underlying instrument that may give rise to contractual obligations additional to those of the transaction, the end date of a transaction shall be determined on the basis of the last contractual payment of the underlying instrument of the transaction.Where a transaction is structured to settle an outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset so that the market value of the transaction is zero on those specified dates, the settlement of the outstanding exposure at those specified dates is considered a contractual payment under the same transaction;
- (b)for transactions mapped to the foreign exchange risk category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as follows:(i)where the transaction consists of one payment leg, the adjusted notional amount shall be the notional amount of the derivative contract;(ii)where the transaction consists of two payment legs and the notional amount of one payment leg is denominated in the institution's reporting currency, the adjusted notional amount shall be the notional amount of the other payment leg;(iii)where the transaction consists of two payment legs and the notional amount of each payment leg is denominated in a currency other than the institution's reporting currency, the adjusted notional amount shall be the largest of the notional amounts of the two payment legs after those amounts have been converted into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate;
- (c)for transactions mapped to the equity risk category or commodity risk category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as the product of the market price of one unit of the underlying instrument of the transaction and the number of units in the underlying instrument referenced by the transaction;where a transaction mapped to the equity risk category or commodity risk category is contractually expressed as a notional amount, institutions shall use the notional amount of the transaction rather than the number of units in the underlying instrument as the adjusted notional amount;
- (d)for transactions mapped to the other risks category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount on the basis of the most appropriate method among the methods set out in points (a), (b) and (c), depending on the nature and characteristics of the underlying instrument of the transaction.


**2.** Institutions shall determine the notional amount or number of units of the underlying instrument for the purpose of calculating the adjusted notional amount of a transaction referred to in paragraph 1 as follows:
- (a)where the notional amount or the number of units of the underlying instrument of a transaction is not fixed until its contractual maturity:(i)for deterministic notional amounts and numbers of units of the underlying instrument, the notional amount shall be the weighted average of all the deterministic values of notional amounts or number of units of the underlying instrument, as applicable, until the contractual maturity of the transaction, where the weights are the proportion of the time period during which each value of notional amount applies;(ii)for stochastic notional amounts and numbers of units of the underlying instrument, the notional amount shall be the amount determined by fixing current market values within the formula for calculating the future market values;
- (b)for contracts with multiple exchanges of the notional amount, the notional amount shall be multiplied by the number of remaining payments still to be made in accordance with the contracts;
- (c)for contracts that provide for a multiplication of the cash-flow payments or a multiplication of the underlying of the derivative contract, the notional amount shall be adjusted by an institution to take into account the effects of the multiplication on the risk structure of those contracts.


**3.** Institutions shall convert the adjusted notional amount of a transaction into their reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate where the adjusted notional amount is calculated under this Article from a contractual notional amount or a market price of the number of units of the underlying instrument denominated in another currency.


# Article 279c

**Maturity Factor**

*Article 279C*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the maturity factor as follows:
- (a)for transactions included in the netting sets referred to in Article 275(1), institutions shall use the following formula:
$$MF = \min
(\max
(M, 10 / OneBusinessYear), 1)$$
where:
- **MF**=the maturity factor;
- **M**=the remaining maturity of the transaction which is equal to the period of time needed for the termination of all contractual obligations of the transaction; for that purpose, any optionality of a derivative contract shall be considered to be a contractual obligation; the remaining maturity shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention;where a transaction has another derivative contract as underlying instrument that may give rise to additional contractual obligations beyond the contractual obligations of the transaction, the remaining maturity of the transaction shall be equal to the period of time needed for the termination of all contractual obligations of the underlying instrument;where a transaction is structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset so that the market value of the transaction is zero on those specified dates, the remaining maturity of the transaction shall be equal to the time until the next reset date; and
- **OneBusinessYear**=one year expressed in business days using the relevant business day convention;
- (b)for transactions included in the netting sets referred to in Article 275(2) and (3), the maturity factor is defined as:
$$MF = 
\frac{3}{2}
\frac{MPOR}{OneBusinessYear}$$
where:
- **MF**=the maturity factor;
- **MPOR**=the margin period of risk of the netting set determined in accordance with Article 285(2) to (5); and
- **OneBusinessYear**=one year expressed in business days using the relevant business day convention.When determining the margin period of risk for transactions between a client and a clearing member, an institution acting either as the client or as the clearing member shall replace the minimum period set out in point (b) of Article 285(2) with five business days.


**2.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, the remaining maturity shall be equal to the period of time until the next reset date for transactions that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset in such a way that the market value of the contract shall be zero on those specified payment dates.

# Article 282

**Calculation of the exposure value**

*Article 282*


**1.** Institutions may calculate a single exposure value for all the transactions within a contractual netting agreement where all the conditions set out in Article 274(1) are met. Otherwise, institutions shall calculate an exposure value separately for each transaction, which shall be treated as its own netting set.


**2.** The exposure value of a netting set or a transaction shall be the product of 1,4 times the sum of the current replacement cost and the potential future exposure.


**3.** The current replacement cost referred to in paragraph 2 shall be calculated as follows:
- (a)for netting sets of transactions: that are traded on a recognised exchange; centrally cleared by a central counterparty authorised in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 or recognised in accordance with Article 25 of that Regulation; or for which collateral is exchanged bilaterally with the counterparty in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, institutions shall use the following formula:RC = TH + MTAwhere:
- **RC**=the replacement cost;
- **TH**=the margin threshold applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement below which the institution cannot call for collateral; and
- **MTA**=the minimum transfer amount applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement;
- (b)for all other netting sets or individual transactions, institutions shall use the following formula:RC = max{CMV, 0}where:
- **RC**=the replacement cost; and
- **CMV**=the current market value.In order to calculate the current replacement cost, institutions shall update current market values at least monthly.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate the potential future exposure referred to in paragraph 2 as follows:
- (a)the potential future exposure of a netting set is the sum of the potential future exposure of all the transactions included in the netting set, calculated in accordance with point (b);
- (b)the potential future exposure of a single transaction is its notional amount multiplied by:(i)the product of 0,5 % and the residual maturity of the transaction expressed in years for interest-rate derivative contracts;(ii)the product of 6 % and the residual maturity of the transaction expressed in years for credit derivative contracts;(iii)4 % for foreign-exchange derivatives;(iv)18 % for gold and commodity derivatives other than electricity derivatives;(v)40 % for electricity derivatives;(vi)32 % for equity derivatives;
- (c)the notional amount referred to in point (b) of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Article 279b(2) and (3) for all derivatives listed in that point; in addition, the notional amount of the derivatives referred to in points (b)(iii) to (b)(vi) of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with points (b) and (c) of Article 279b(1);
- (d)the potential future exposure of netting sets referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3 shall be multiplied by 0,42.For calculating the potential exposure of interest-rate derivatives and credit derivatives in accordance with points b(i) and (b)(ii), an institution may choose to use the original maturity instead of the residual maturity of the contracts.


# Article 283

**Permission to use the Internal Model Method**

*Article 283*


**1.** Provided that the competent authorities are satisfied that the requirement in paragraph 2 have been met by an institution, they shall permit that institution to use the Internal Model Method (IMM) to calculate the exposure value for any of the following transactions:
- (a)transactions in Article 273(2)(a);
- (b)transactions in Article 273(2)(b), (c) and (d);
- (c)transactions in Article 273(2)(a) to (d),Where an institution is permitted to use the IMM to calculate exposure value for any of the transactions mentioned in points (a) to (c) of the first subparagraph, it may also use the IMM for the transactions in Article 273(2)(e).Notwithstanding the third subparagraph of Article 273(1), an institution may choose not to apply this method to exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. In such case, an institution shall apply one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 5 to these exposures where the relevant requirements for each approach are met.


**2.** Competent authorities shall permit institutions to use IMM for the calculations referred to in paragraph 1 only if the institution has demonstrated that it complies with the requirements set out in this Section, and the competent authorities verified that the systems for the management of CCR maintained by the institution are sound and properly implemented.


**3.** The competent authorities may permit institutions for a limited period to implement the IMM sequentially across different transaction types. During this period of sequential implementation institutions may use the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 for transaction type for which they do not use the IMM.


**4.** For all OTC derivative transactions, and for long settlement transactions for which an institution has not received permission under paragraph 1 to use the IMM, the institution shall use the methods set out in Section 3. Those methods may be used in combination on a permanent basis within a group.


**5.** An institution which is permitted in accordance with paragraph 1 to use the IMM shall not revert to the use of the methods set out in Section 3 or Section 5 unless it is permitted by the competent authority to do so. Competent authorities shall give such permission if the institution demonstrates good cause.


**6.** If an institution ceases to comply with the requirements laid down in this Section, it shall notify the competent authority and do one of the following:
- (a)present to the competent authority a plan for a timely return to compliance;
- (b)demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the effect of non-compliance is immaterial.


# Article 284

**Exposure value**

*Article 284*


**1.** Where an institution is permitted, in accordance with Article 283(1), to use the IMM to calculate the exposure value of some or all transactions mentioned in that paragraph, it shall measure the exposure value of those transactions at the level of the netting set.The model used by the institution for that purpose shall:
- (a)specify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to joint changes in relevant market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates;
- (b)calculate the exposure value for the netting set at each of the future dates on the basis of the joint changes in the market variables.


**2.** In order for the model to capture the effects of margining, the model of the collateral value shall meet the quantitative, qualitative and data requirements for the IMM in accordance with this Section and the institution may include in its forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set only eligible financial collateral as referred to in Articles 197 and 198 and points (c) and (d) of Article 299(2).


**3.** The own funds requirement for counterparty credit risk with respect to the CCR exposures to which an institution applies the IMM, shall be the higher of the following:
- (a)the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of Effective EPE using current market data;
- (b)the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of Effective EPE using a single consistent stress calibration for all CCR exposures to which they apply the IMM.


**4.** Except for counterparties identified as having Specific Wrong-Way risk that fall within the scope of Article 291(4) and (5), institutions shall calculate the exposure value as the product of alpha (α) times Effective EPE, as follows:
*Exposure value = α · Effective EPE*where:
- **α**=1.4, unless competent authorities require a higher α or permit institutions to use their own estimates in accordance with paragraph 9;Effective EPE shall be calculated by estimating expected exposure (EEt) as the average exposure at future date t, where the average is taken across possible future values of relevant market risk factors.The model shall estimate EE at a series of future dates t1, t2, t3, etc.


**5.** Effective EE shall be calculated recursively as:
$$Effective EE
_{tk} = \max
(Effective EE
_{tk  - 1}, EE
_{tk})$$
where:
- the current date is denoted as t0;
- Effective EEt0 equals current exposure.


**6.** Effective EPE is the average Effective EE during the first year of future exposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature within less than one year, EPE shall be the average of EE until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE shall be calculated as a weighted average of Effective EE:
$$
*Effective EPE* = 
\frac{1}{
*\min*
(1
*year, maturity*)} \times 
\sum
_{
*k* = 1}
*Effective EE*
_{
*t*
_{
*k*}} \times Δ
*t*
_{
*k*}$$
where the weights 
$$Δt
_{k} =  t
_{k} -  t
_{k  - 1}$$
 allow for the case when future exposure is calculated at dates that are not equally spaced over time.


**7.** Institutions shall calculate EE or peak exposure measures on the basis of a distribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non-normality of the distribution of exposures.


**8.** An institution may use a measure of the distribution calculated by the IMM that is more conservative than α multiplied by Effective EPE as calculated in accordance with the equation in paragraph 4 for every counterparty.


**9.** Notwithstanding paragraph 4, competent authorities may permit institutions to use their own estimates of alpha, where:
- (a)alpha shall equal the ratio of internal capital from a full simulation of CCR exposure across counterparties (numerator) and internal capital based on EPE (denominator);
- (b)in the denominator, EPE shall be used as if it were a fixed outstanding amount.When estimated in accordance with this paragraph, alpha shall be no lower than 1,2.


**10.** For the purposes of an estimate of alpha under paragraph 9, an institution shall ensure that the numerator and denominator are calculated in a manner consistent with the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used to estimate α shall be based on the institution's internal capital approach, be well documented and be subject to independent validation. In addition, an institution shall review its estimates of alpha on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. An institution shall also assess the model risk.


**11.** An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that its internal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator material sources of dependency of distribution of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties. Internal estimates of alpha shall take account of the granularity of portfolios.


**12.** In supervising the use of estimates under paragraph 9, competent authorities shall have regard to the significant variation in estimates of alpha that arises from the potential for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present.


**13.** Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint modelling of market and credit risk shall be conditioned on the credit risk factor to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn.


# Article 285

**Exposure value for netting sets subject to a margin agreement**

*Article 285*


**1.** If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and daily mark-to-market valuation, the institution shall calculate Effective EPE as set out in this paragraph. If the model captures the effects of margining when estimating EE, the institution may, subject to the permission of the competent authority, use the model's EE measure directly in the equation in Article 284(5). Competent authorities shall grant such permission only if they verify that the model properly captures the effects of margining when estimating EE. An institution that has not received such permission shall use one of the following Effective EPE measures:
- (a)Effective EPE, calculated without taking into account any collateral held or posted by way of margin plus any collateral that has been posted to the counterparty independent of the daily valuation and margining process or current exposure;
- (b)Effective EPE, calculated as the potential increase in exposure over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of:(i)the current exposure including all collateral currently held or posted, other than collateral called or in dispute;(ii)the largest net exposure, including collateral under the margin agreement, that would not trigger a collateral call. This amount shall reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum transfer amounts, independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement.For the purposes of point (b), institutions shall calculate the add-on as the expected positive change of the mark-to-market value of the transactions during the margin period of risk. Changes in the value of collateral shall be reflected using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach in accordance with Section 4 of Chapter 4 or the own estimates of volatility adjustments of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, but no collateral payments shall be assumed during the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk is subject to the minimum periods set out in paragraphs 2 to 5.


**2.** For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling the exposure value with margin agreements shall not be less than:
- (a)5 business days for netting sets consisting only of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions and margin lending transactions;
- (b)10 business days for all other netting sets.


**3.** Points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 shall be subject to the following exceptions:
- (a)for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5 000 at any point during a quarter, the margin period of risk for the following quarter shall not be less than 20 business days. This exception shall not apply to institutions' trade exposures;
- (b)for netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the margin period of risk shall not be less than 20 business days.An institution shall determine whether collateral is illiquid or whether OTC derivatives cannot be easily replaced in the context of stressed market conditions, characterised by the absence of continuously active markets where a counterparty would, within two days or fewer, obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market discount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative).An institution shall consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution would be able to replace those trades or securities.


**4.** If an institution has been involved in more than two margin call disputes on a particular netting set over the immediately preceding two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk under paragraphs 2 and 3, the institution shall use a margin period of risk that is at least double the period specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters.


**5.** For re-margining with a periodicity of N days, the margin period of risk shall be at least equal to the period specified in paragraphs 2 and 3, F, plus N days minus one day. That is:
*Margin Period of Risk* = 
*F + N* – 1


**6.** If the internal model includes the effect of margining on changes in the market value of the netting set, an institution shall model collateral, other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, jointly with the exposure in its exposure value calculations for OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions.


**7.** If an institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure, it shall not recognise in its exposure value calculations for OTC derivatives the effect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, unless the institution uses the volatility adjustments under the standard Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach in accordance with Chapter 4.


**7a.** If an institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure, it shall not recognise in its exposure value calculations for securities financing transactions the effect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself.


**8.** An institution using the IMM shall ignore in its models the effect of a reduction of the exposure value due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates.


# Article 286

**Management of CCR — Policies, processes and systems**

*Article 286*


**1.** An institution shall establish and maintain a CCR management framework, consisting of:
- (a)policies, processes and systems to ensure the identification, measurement, management, approval and internal reporting of CCR;
- (b)procedures for ensuring that those policies, processes and systems are complied with.Those policies, processes and systems shall be conceptually sound, implemented with integrity and documented. The documentation shall include an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure CCR.


**2.** The CCR management framework required by paragraph 1 shall take account of market, liquidity, and legal and operational risks that are associated with CCR. In particular, the framework shall ensure that the institution complies with the following principles:
- (a)it does not undertake business with a counterparty without assessing its creditworthiness;
- (b)it takes due account of settlement and pre-settlement credit risk;
- (c)it manages such risks as comprehensively as practicable at the counterparty level by aggregating CCR exposures with other credit exposures and at the firm-wide level.


**3.** An institution using the IMM shall ensure that its CCR management framework accounts to the satisfaction of the competent authority for the liquidity risks of all of the following:
- (a)potential incoming margin calls in the context of exchanges of variation margin or other margin types, such as initial or independent margin, under adverse market shocks;
- (b)potential incoming calls for the return of excess collateral posted by counterparties;
- (c)calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own external credit quality assessment.An institution shall ensure that the nature and horizon of collateral re-use is consistent with its liquidity needs and does not jeopardise its ability to post or return collateral in a timely manner.


**4.** An institution's management body and senior management shall be actively involved in, and ensure that adequate resources are allocated to, the management of CCR. Senior management shall be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the model used and the impact those limitations and assumptions can have on the reliability of the output through a formal process. Senior management shall be also aware of the uncertainties of the market environment and operational issues and of how these are reflected in the model.


**5.** The daily reports prepared on an institution's exposures to CCR in accordance with Article 287(2)(b) shall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual credit managers or traders and reductions in the institution's overall CCR exposure.


**6.** An institution's CCR management framework established in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be used in conjunction with internal credit and trading limits. Credit and trading limits shall be related to the institution's risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by credit managers, traders and senior management. An institution shall have a formal process to report breaches of risk limits to the appropriate level of management.


**7.** An institution's measurement of CCR shall include measuring daily and intra-day use of credit lines. The institution shall measure current exposure gross and net of collateral. At portfolio and counterparty level, the institution shall calculate and monitor peak exposure or potential future exposure at the confidence interval chosen by the institution. The institution shall take account of large or concentrated positions, including by groups of related counterparties, by industry and by market.


**8.** An institution shall establish and maintain a routine and rigorous program of stress testing. The results of that stress testing shall be reviewed regularly and at least quarterly by senior management and shall be reflected in the CCR policies and limits set by the management body or senior management. Where stress tests reveal particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, the institution shall take prompt steps to manage those risks.


# Article 287

**Organisation structures for CCR management**

*Article 287*


**1.** An institution using the IMM shall establish and maintain:
- (a)a risk control unit that complies with paragraph 2;
- (b)a collateral management unit that complies with paragraph 3.


**2.** The risk control unit shall be responsible for the design and implementation of its CCR management, including the initial and on-going validation of the model, and shall carry out the following functions and meet the following requirements:
- (a)it shall be responsible for the design and implementation of the CCR management system of the institution;
- (b)it shall produce daily reports on and analyse the output of the institution's risk measurement model. That analysis shall include an evaluation of the relationship between measures of CCR exposure values and trading limits;
- (c)it shall control input data integrity and produce and analyse reports on the output of the institution's risk measurement model, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and credit and trading limits;
- (d)it shall be independent from units responsible for originating, renewing or trading exposures and free from undue influence;
- (e)it shall be adequately staffed;
- (f)it shall report directly to the senior management of the institution;
- (g)its work shall be closely integrated into the day-to-day credit risk management process of the institution;
- (h)its output shall be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the institution's credit and overall risk profile.


**3.** The collateral management unit shall carry out the following tasks and functions:
- (a)calculating and making margin calls, managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis;
- (b)controlling the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensuring that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of data within the institution;
- (c)tracking the extent of re-use of collateral and any amendment of the rights of the institution to or in connection with the collateral that it posts;
- (d)reporting to the appropriate level of management the types of collateral assets that are reused, and the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and maturity;
- (e)tracking concentration to individual types of collateral assets accepted by the institution;
- (f)reporting collateral management information on a regular basis, but at least quarterly, to senior management, including information on the type of collateral received and posted, the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes. That internal reporting shall also reflect trends in these figures.


**4.** Senior management shall allocate sufficient resources to the collateral management unit required under paragraph 1(b) to ensure that its systems achieve an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of margin calls by the institution and the timeliness of the response of the institution to margin calls by its counterparties. Senior management shall ensure that the unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the institution to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes.


# Article 288

**Review of CCR management system**

*Article 288*

An institution shall regularly conduct an independent review of its CCR management system through its internal auditing process. That review shall include both the activities of the control and collateral management units required by Article 287 and shall specifically address, as a minimum:
- (a)the adequacy of the documentation of the CCR management system and process required by Article 286;
- (b)the organisation of the CCR control unit required by Article 287(1)(a);

- (m)the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations;
- (n)the verification of the model's accuracy through frequent back-testing as set out in points (b) to (e) of Article 293(1);
- (o)the compliance of the CCR control unit and collateral management unit with the relevant regulatory requirements.
# Article 289

**Use test**

*Article 289*


**1.** Institutions shall ensure that the distribution of exposures generated by the model used to calculate Effective EPE is closely integrated into the day-to-day CCR management process of the institution, and that the output of the model is taken into account in the process of credit approval, CCR management, internal capital allocation and corporate governance.


**2.** The institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that it has been using a model to calculate the distribution of exposures upon which the EPE calculation is based that meets, broadly, the requirements set out in this Section for at least one year prior to permission to use the IMM by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283.


**3.** The model used to generate a distribution of exposures to CCR shall be part of the CCR management framework required by Article 286. This framework shall include the measurement of usage of credit lines, aggregating CCR exposures with other credit exposures and internal capital allocation.


**4.** In addition to EPE, an institution shall measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution shall measure current exposure gross and net of collateral. The use test is satisfied if an institution uses other CCR measures, such as peak exposure, based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same model to compute EPE.


**5.** An institution shall have the systems capability to estimate EE daily if necessary, unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of its competent authorities that its exposures to CCR warrant less frequent calculation. The institution shall estimate EE along a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts and in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposures.


**6.** Exposure shall be measured, monitored and controlled over the life of all contracts in the netting set and not only to the one-year horizon. The institution shall have procedures in place to identify and control the risks for counterparties where the exposure rises beyond the one-year horizon. The forecast increase in exposure shall be an input into the institution's internal capital model.


# Article 290

**Stress testing**

*Article 290*


**1.** An institution shall have a comprehensive stress testing programme for CCR, including for use in assessment of own funds requirements for CCR, which complies with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2 to 10.


**2.** It shall identify possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on an institution's credit exposures and assess the institution's ability to withstand such changes.


**3.** The stress measures under the programme shall be compared against risk limits and considered by the institution as part of the process set out in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU.


**4.** The programme shall comprehensively capture trades and aggregate exposures across all forms of counterparty credit risk at the level of specific counterparties in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing.


**5.** It shall provide for at least monthly exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors such as interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices for all counterparties of the institution, in order to identify, and enable the institution when necessary to reduce outsized concentrations in specific directional risks. Exposure stress testing -including single factor, multifactor and material non-directional risks- and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness shall be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group and aggregate institution-wide CCR levels.


**6.** It shall apply at least quarterly multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material non-directional risks including yield curve exposure and basis risks. Multiple-factor stress tests shall, at a minimum, address the following scenarios in which the following occurs:
- (a)severe economic or market events have occurred;
- (b)broad market liquidity has decreased significantly;
- (c)a large financial intermediary is liquidating positions.


**7.** The severity of the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, the shocks of the underlying risk factors shall be sufficiently severe to capture historical extreme market environments and extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The stress tests shall evaluate the impact of such shocks on own funds, own funds requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations the testing programme shall also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability.


**8.** The programme shall include provision, where appropriate, for reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes. Reverse stress testing shall account for the impact of material non-linearity in the portfolio.


**9.** The results of the stress testing under the programme shall be reported regularly, at least on a quarterly basis, to senior management. The reports and analysis of the results shall cover the largest counterparty-level impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends.


**10.** Senior management shall take a lead role in the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the institution and ensure that the results are meaningful and used to manage CCR. The results of stress testing for significant exposures shall be assessed against guidelines that indicate the institution's risk appetite, and referred to senior management for discussion and action when excessive or concentrated risks are identified.


# Article 291

**Wrong-Way Risk**

*Article 291*


**1.** For the purposes of this Article:
- (a)"General Wrong-Way risk" arises when the likelihood of default by counterparties is positively correlated with general market risk factors;
- (b)"Specific Wrong-Way risk" arises when future exposure to a specific counterparty is positively correlated with the counterparty's PD due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty. An institution shall be considered to be exposed to Specific Wrong-Way risk if the future exposure to a specific counterparty is expected to be high when the counterparty's probability of a default is also high.


**2.** An institution shall give due consideration to exposures that give rise to a significant degree of Specific and General Wrong-Way risk.


**3.** In order to identify General Wrong-Way risk, an institution shall design stress testing and scenario analyses to stress risk factors that are adversely related to counterparty creditworthiness. Such testing shall address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. An institution shall monitor General Wrong Way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are relevant to the business.


**4.** An institution shall maintain procedures to identify, monitor and control cases of Specific Wrong-Way risk for each legal entity, beginning at the inception of a transaction and continuing through the life of the transaction.


**5.** Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for CCR in relation to transactions where Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified and where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the issuer of the underlying of the OTC derivative or the underlying of the transactions referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 273(2)), in accordance with the following principles:
- (a)the instruments where Specific Wrong-Way risk exists shall not be included in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty, and shall each be treated as a separate netting set;
- (b)within any such separate netting set, for single-name credit default swaps the exposure value equals the full expected loss in the value of the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments based on the assumption that the underlying issuer is in liquidation;
- (c)LGD for an institution using the approach set out in Chapter 3 shall be 100 % for such swap transactions;
- (d)for an institution using the approach set out in Chapter 2, the applicable risk weight shall be that of an unsecured transaction;
- (e)for all other transactions referencing a single name in any such separate netting set, the calculation of the exposure value shall be consistent with the assumption of a jump-to-default of those underlying obligations where the issuer is legally connected with the counterparty. For transactions referencing a basket of names or index, the jump-to-default of the respective underlying obligations where the issuer is legally connected with the counterparty, shall be applied, if material;
- (f)to the extent that the calculation uses existing market risk calculations for own funds requirements for default risk as set out in Title IV, Chapter 1a, Section 4 or 5, or for default risk using an internal default risk model as set out in Title IV, Chapter 1b, Section 3, that already contain an LGD assumption, the LGD in the formula used shall be 100 %.


**6.** Institutions shall provide senior management and the appropriate committee of the management body with regular reports on both Specific and General Wrong-Way risks and the steps being taken to manage those risks.


# Article 292

**Integrity of the modelling process**

*Article 292*


**1.** An institution shall ensure the integrity of modelling process as set out in Article 284 by adopting at least the following measures:
- (a)the model shall reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete, and conservative fashion;
- (b)those terms shall include at least contract notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, margining arrangements and netting arrangements;
- (c)those terms and specifications shall be maintained in a database that is subject to formal and periodic audit;
- (d)a process for recognising netting arrangements that requires legal staff to verify that netting under those arrangements is legally enforceable;
- (e)the verification required under point (d) shall be entered into the database mentioned in point (c) by an independent unit;
- (f)the transmission of transaction terms and specification data to the EPE model shall be subject to internal audit;
- (g)there shall be processes for formal reconciliation between the model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively.


**2.** Current market data shall be used to determine current exposures. An institution may calibrate its EPE model using either historic market data or market implied data to establish parameters of the underlying stochastic processes, such as drift, volatility and correlation. If an institution uses historical data, it shall use at least three years of such data. The data shall be updated at least quarterly, and more frequently if necessary to reflect market conditions.To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress calibration, an institution shall calibrate Effective EPE using either three years of data that includes a period of stress to the credit default spreads of its counterparties or market implied data from such a period of stress.The requirements in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be applied by the institution for that purpose.


**3.** An institution shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority, at least quarterly, that the stress period used for the calculation under this paragraph coincides with a period of increased credit default swap or other credit (such as loan or corporate bond) spreads for a representative selection of its counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, it shall map that counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types.


**4.** The EPE model for all counterparties shall use data, either historic or implied, that include the data from the stressed credit period and shall use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the EPE model to current data.


**5.** To evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration for EEPE, an institution shall create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the main risk factors to which the institution is exposed. The exposure to these benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using (a) a stress methodology, based on current market values and model parameters calibrated to stressed market conditions, and (b) the exposure generated during the stress period, but applying the method set out in this Section (end of stress period market value, volatilities, and correlations from the 3-year stress period).The competent authorities shall require an institution to adjust the stress calibration if the exposures of those benchmark portfolios deviate substantially from each other.


**6.** An institution shall subject the model to a validation process that is clearly articulated in the institutions' policies and procedures. That validation process shall:
- (a)specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which the assumptions underlying the model are inappropriate and may therefore result in an understatement of EPE;
- (b)include a review of the comprehensiveness of the model.


**7.** An institution shall monitor the relevant risks and have processes in place to adjust its estimation of Effective EPE when those risks become significant. In complying with this paragraph, the institution shall:
- (a)identify and manage its exposures to Specific Wrong-Way risk arising as specified in Article 291(1)(b) and exposures to General Wrong-Way risk arising as specified in Article 291(1)(a);
- (b)for exposures with a rising risk profile after one year, compare on a regular basis the estimate of a relevant measure of exposure over one year with the same exposure measure over the life of the exposure;
- (c)for exposures with a residual maturity below one year, compare on a regular basis the replacement cost (current exposure) and the realised exposure profile, and store data that would allow such a comparison.


**8.** An institution shall have internal procedures to verify that, prior to including a transaction in a netting set, the transaction is covered by a legally enforceable netting contract that meets the requirements set out in Section 7.


**9.** An institution that uses collateral to mitigate its CCR shall have internal procedures to verify that, prior to recognising the effect of collateral in its calculations, the collateral meets the legal certainty standards set out in Chapter 4.


**10.** EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines on the application of this Article.


# Article 293

**Requirements for the risk management system**

*Article 293*


**1.** An institution shall comply with the following requirements:
- (a)it shall meet the qualitative requirements set out in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5;
- (b)it shall conduct a regular programme of back-testing, comparing the risk measures generated by the model with realised risk measures, and hypothetical changes based on static positions with realised measures;
- (c)it shall carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic review of its CCR exposure model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and review shall be independent of the model development;
- (d)the management body and senior management shall be involved in the risk control process and shall ensure that adequate resources are devoted to credit and counterparty credit risk control. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by the independent risk control unit established in accordance Article 287(1)(a) shall be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the overall risk exposure of the institution;
- (e)the internal risk measurement exposure model shall be integrated into the day-to-day risk management process of the institution;
- (f)the risk measurement system shall be used in conjunction with internal trading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits shall be related to the institution's risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management;
- (g)an institution shall ensure that its risk management system is well documented. In particular, it shall maintain a documented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system, and arrangements to ensure that those policies are complied with;
- (h)an independent review of the risk measurement system shall be carried out regularly in the institution's own internal auditing process. This review shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management process shall take place at regular intervals (and no less than once a year) and shall specifically address, as a minimum, all items referred to in Article 288;
- (i)the on-going validation of counterparty credit risk models, including back-testing, shall be reviewed periodically by a level of management with sufficient authority to decide the action that will be taken to address weaknesses in the models.


**2.** Competent authorities shall take into account the extent to which an institution meets the requirements of paragraph 1 when setting the level of alpha, as set out in Article 284(4). Only those institutions that comply fully with those requirements shall be eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor.


**3.** An institution shall document the process for initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and the calculation of the risk measures generated by the models to a level of detail that would enable a third party to recreate, respectively, the analysis and the risk measures. That documentation shall set out the frequency with which back testing analysis and any other on-going validation will be conducted, how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios and the analyses that are used.


**4.** An institution shall define criteria with which to assess its CCR exposure models and the models that input into the calculation of exposure and maintain a written policy that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be identified and remedied.


**5.** An institution shall define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for the purposes of validating an CCR exposure model and its risk measures.


**6.** The validation of CCR exposure models and their risk measures that produce forecast distributions shall consider more than a single statistic of the forecast distribution.


# Article 294

**Validation requirements**

*Article 294*


**1.** As part of the initial and on-going validation of its CCR exposure model and its risk measures, an institution shall ensure that the following requirements are met:
- (a)the institution shall carry out back-testing using historical data on movements in market risk factors prior to the permission by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283(1). That back-testing shall consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various initialisation dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;
- (b)the institution using the approach set out in Article 285(1)(b) shall regularly validate its model to test whether realised current exposures are consistent with prediction over all margin periods within one year. If some of the trades in the netting set have a maturity of less than one year, and the netting set has higher risk factor sensitivities without these trades, the validation shall take this into account;
- (c)it shall back-test the performance of its CCR exposure model and the model's relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons considered shall include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collateralised or margined trading;
- (d)if the model validation indicates that Effective EPE is underestimated, the institution shall take the action necessary to address the inaccuracy of the model;
- (e)it shall test the pricing models used to calculate CCR exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors as part of the initial and on-going model validation process. Pricing models for options shall account for the nonlinearity of option value with respect to market risk factors;
- (f)the CCR exposure model shall capture the transaction-specific information necessary to be able to aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. An institution shall verify that transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;
- (g)the CCR exposure model shall include transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining. It shall take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model shall account for the nature of margin agreements that are unilateral or bilateral, the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the minimum threshold of un-margined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model shall either estimate the mark-to-market change in the value of collateral posted or apply the rules set out in Chapter 4;
- (h)the model validation process shall include static, historical back-testing on representative counterparty portfolios. An institution shall conduct such back-testing on a number of representative counterparty portfolios that are actual or hypothetical at regular intervals. Those representative portfolios shall be chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to the material risk factors and combinations of risk factors to which the institution is exposed;
- (i)an institution shall conduct back-testing that is designed to test the key assumptions of the CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures, including the modelled relationship between tenors of the same risk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;
- (j)the performance of CCR exposure models and its risk measures shall be subject to appropriate back-testing practice. The back testing programme shall be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model's risk measures;
- (k)an institution shall validate its CCR exposure models and all risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using IMM in accordance to the Article 283;
- (l)an institution shall regularly test the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the on-going model validation process;
- (m)the on-going validation of an institution's CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures shall include an assessment of the adequacy of the recent performance;
- (n)the frequency with which the parameters of an CCR exposure model are updated shall be assessed by an institution as part of the initial and on-going validation process;
- (o)the initial and on-going validation of CCR exposure models shall assess whether or not the counterparty level and netting set exposure calculations of exposure are appropriate.


**2.** A measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate regulatory exposure value for every counterparty may be used in place of alpha multiplied by Effective EPE with the prior permission of the competent authorities. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial approval by the competent authorities and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE models. An institution shall validate the conservatism regularly. The on-going assessment of model performance shall cover all counterparties for which the models are used.


**3.** If back-testing indicates that a model is not sufficiently accurate, the competent authorities shall revoke its permission for the model, or impose appropriate measures to ensure that the model is improved promptly.


# Article 295

**Recognition of contractual netting as risk-reducing**

*Article 295*

Institutions may treat as risk reducing in accordance with Article 298 only the following types of contractual netting agreements where the netting agreement has been recognised by competent authorities in accordance with Article 296 and where the institution meets the requirements set out in Article 297:
- (a)bilateral contracts for novation between an institution and its counterparty under which mutual claims and obligations are automatically amalgamated in such a way that the novation fixes one single net amount each time it applies so as to create a single new contract that replaces all former contracts and all obligations between parties pursuant to those contracts and is binding on the parties;
- (b)other bilateral agreements between an institution and its counterparty;
- (c)contractual cross-product netting agreements for institutions that have received the approval to use the method set out in Section 6 for transactions falling under the scope of that method. Competent authorities shall report to EBA a list of the contractual cross-product netting agreements approved.Netting across transactions entered into by different legal entities of a group shall not be recognised for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements.
# Article 296

**Recognition of contractual netting agreements**

*Article 296*


**1.** Competent authorities shall recognise a contractual netting agreement only where the conditions in paragraph 2 and, where relevant, 3 are fulfilled.


**2.** The following conditions shall be fulfilled by all contractual netting agreements used by an institution for the purposes of determining exposure value in this Part:
- (a)the institution has concluded a contractual netting agreement with its counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that, in the event of default by the counterparty it would be entitled to receive or obliged to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions;
- (b)the institution has made available to the competent authorities written and reasoned legal opinions to the effect that, in the event of a legal challenge of the netting agreement, the institution's claims and obligations would not exceed those referred to in point (a). The legal opinion shall refer to the applicable law:(i)the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated;(ii)if a branch of an undertaking is involved, which is located in a country other than that where the undertaking is incorporated, the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;(iii)the jurisdiction whose law governs the individual transactions included in the netting agreement;(iv)the jurisdiction whose law governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the contractual netting;
- (c)credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure across transactions with each counterparty. This aggregation shall be factored into credit limit purposes and internal capital purposes;
- (d)the contract shall not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor (i.e. walk-away clause).If any of the competent authorities are not satisfied that the contractual netting is legally valid and enforceable under the law of each of the jurisdictions referred to in point (b) the contractual netting agreement shall not be recognised as risk-reducing for either of the counterparties. Competent authorities shall inform each other accordingly.


**3.** The legal opinions referred to in point (b) may be drawn up by reference to types of contractual netting. The following additional conditions shall be fulfilled by contractual cross-product netting agreements:
- (a)the net sum referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 is the net sum of the positive and negative close out values of any included individual bilateral master agreement and of the positive and negative mark-to-market value of the individual transactions (the "cross-product net amount");
- (b)the legal opinions referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 shall address the validity and enforceability of the entire contractual cross-product netting agreement under its terms and the impact of the netting arrangement on the material provisions of any included individual bilateral master agreement.


# Article 297

**Obligations of institutions**

*Article 297*


**1.** An institution shall establish and maintain procedures to ensure that the legal validity and enforceability of its contractual netting is reviewed in the light of changes in the law of relevant jurisdictions referred to in Article 296(2)(b).


**2.** The institution shall maintain all required documentation relating to its contractual netting in its files.


**3.** The institution shall factor the effects of netting into its measurement of each counterparty's aggregate credit risk exposure and the institution shall manage its CCR on the basis of those effects of that measurement.


**4.** In the case of contractual cross-product netting agreements referred to in Article 295, the institution shall maintain procedures under Article 296(2)(c) to verify that any transaction which is to be included in a netting set is covered by a legal opinion referred to in Article 296(2)(b).Taking into account the contractual cross-product netting agreement, the institution shall continue to comply with the requirements for the recognition of bilateral netting and the requirements of Chapter 4 for the recognition of credit risk mitigation, as applicable, with respect to each included individual bilateral master agreement and transaction.


# Article 298

**Effects of recognition of netting as risk-reducing**

*Article 298*

Netting for the purposes of Sections 3 to 6 shall be recognised as set out in those Sections.
# Article 299

**Items in the trading book**

*Article 299*


**1.** For the purposes of the application of this Article, Annex II shall include a reference to derivative instruments for the transfer of credit risk as mentioned in point (8) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC.


**2.** When calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty risk of items in the trading book, institutions shall comply with the following principles:
- (a)in the case of total return swap credit derivatives and credit default swap credit derivatives, to obtain a figure for potential future credit exposure under the method set out in Section 3, the nominal amount of the instrument shall be multiplied by the following percentages:(i)5 %, where the reference obligation is one that, if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution, would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2;(ii)10 %, where the reference obligation is one that, if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution, would not be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2.In the case of an institution whose exposure arising from a credit default swap represents a long position in the underlying, the percentage for potential future credit exposure may be 0 %, unless the credit default swap is subject to close-out upon the insolvency of the entity whose exposure arising from the swap represents a short position in the underlying, even though the underlying has not defaulted.Where the credit derivative provides protection in relation to "nth to default" amongst a number of underlying obligations, an institution shall determine which of the percentage figures set out in the first subparagraph applies by reference to the obligation with the nth lowest credit quality which, if incurred by the institution, would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2;
- (b)institutions shall not use the Financial Collateral Simple Method set out in Article 222 for the recognition of the effects of financial collateral;
- (c)in the case of repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions booked in the trading book, institutions may recognise as eligible collateral all financial instruments and commodities that are eligible to be included in the trading book;
- (d)for exposures arising from OTC derivative instruments booked in the trading book, institutions may recognise commodities that are eligible to be included in the trading book as eligible collateral;
- (e)for the purposes of calculating volatility adjustments where such financial instruments or commodities which are not eligible under Chapter 4 are lent, sold or provided, or borrowed, purchased or received by way of collateral or otherwise under such a transaction, and an institution is using the Supervisory Volatility Adjustments Approach under Section 3 of Chapter 4, institutions shall treat such instruments and commodities in the same way as non-main index equities listed on a recognised exchange;
- (f)where an institution is using the Own Estimates of Volatility adjustments Approach under Section 3 of Chapter 4 in respect of financial instruments or commodities which are not eligible under Chapter 4, it shall calculate volatility adjustments for each individual item. Where an institution has obtained the approval to use the internal models approach defined in Chapter 4, it may also apply that approach in the trading book;
- (g)in relation to the recognition of master netting agreements covering repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, or other capital market-driven transactions, institutions shall only recognise netting across positions in the trading book and the non-trading book when the netted transactions fulfil the following conditions:(i)all transactions are marked to market daily;(ii)any items borrowed, purchased or received under the transactions may be recognised as eligible financial collateral under Chapter 4 without the application of points (c) to (f) of this paragraph;
- (h)where a credit derivative included in the trading book forms part of an internal hedge and the credit protection is recognised under this Regulation in accordance with Article 204, institutions shall apply one of the following approaches:(i)treat it as if there were no counterparty risk arising from the position in that credit derivative;(ii)consistently include for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk all credit derivatives in the trading book forming part of internal hedges or purchased as protection against a CCR exposure where the credit protection is recognised as eligible under Chapter 4.

**Material scope**

*Article 301*


**1.** This Section applies to the following contracts and transactions, for as long as they are outstanding with a CCP:
- (a)the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives;
- (b)securities financing transactions and fully guaranteed deposit lending or borrowing transactions; and

**1.** Institutions shall monitor all their exposures to CCPs and shall lay down procedures for the regular reporting of information on those exposures to senior management and appropriate committee or committees of the management body.


**2.** Institutions shall assess, through appropriate scenario analysis and stress testing, whether the level of own funds held against exposures to a CCP, including potential future or contingent credit exposures, exposures from default fund contributions and, where the institution is acting as a clearing member, exposures resulting from contractual arrangements as laid down in Article 304, adequately relates to the inherent risks of those exposures.


# Article 303

**Treatment of clearing members' exposures to CCPs**

*Article 303*


**1.** An institution that acts as a clearing member, either for its own purposes or as a financial intermediary between a client and a CCP, shall calculate the own funds requirements for its exposures to a CCP as follows:
- (a)it shall apply the treatment set out in Article 306 to its trade exposures with the CCP;
- (b)it shall apply the treatment set out in Article 307 to its default fund contributions to the CCP.


**2.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, the sum of an institution's own funds requirements for its exposures to a QCCP due to trade exposures and default fund contributions shall be subject to a cap equal to the sum of own funds requirements that would be applied to those same exposures if the CCP were a non-qualifying CCP.


# Article 304

**Treatment of clearing members' exposures to clients**

*Article 304*


**1.** An institution that acts as a clearing member and, in that capacity, acts as a financial intermediary between a client and a CCP shall calculate the own funds requirements for its CCP-related transactions with that client in accordance with Sections 1 to 8 of this Chapter, with Section 4 of Chapter 4 of this Title and with Title VI, as applicable.


**2.** Where an institution acting as a clearing member enters into a contractual arrangement with a client of another clearing member that facilitates, in accordance with Article 48(5) and (6), of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the transfer of positions and collateral referred to in Article 305(2)(b) of this Regulation for that client, and that contractual agreement gives rise to a contingent obligation for that institution, that institution may attribute an exposure value of zero to that contingent obligation.


**3.** Where an institution that acts as a clearing member uses the methods set out in Section 3 or 6 of this Chapter to calculate the own funds requirement for its exposures, the following provisions shall apply:
- (a)by way of derogation from Article 285(2), the institution may use a margin period of risk of at least five business days for its exposures to a client;
- (b)the institution shall apply a margin period of risk of at least 10 business days for its exposures to a CCP;
- (c)by way of derogation from Article 285(3), where a netting set included in the calculation meets the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph, the institution may disregard the limit set out in that point, provided that the netting set does not meet the condition set out in point (b) of that paragraph and does not contain disputed trades or exotic options;
- (d)where a CCP retains variation margin against a transaction, and the institution's collateral is not protected against the insolvency of the CCP, the institution shall apply a margin period of risk that is the lower of one year and the remaining maturity of the transaction, with a floor of 10 business days.


**4.** By way of derogation from point (i) of Article 281(2), where an institution that acts as a clearing member uses the method set out in Section 4 to calculate the own funds requirement for its exposures to a client, the institution may use a maturity factor of 0,21 for its calculation.


**5.** By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 282(4), where an institution that acts as a clearing member uses the method set out in Section 5 to calculate the own funds requirement for its exposures to a client, that institution may use a maturity factor of 0,21 in that calculation.


**6.** An institution that acts as a clearing member may use the reduced exposure at default resulting from the calculations set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 for the purposes of calculating its own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Title VI.


**7.** An institution that acts as a clearing member that collects collateral from a client for a CCP-related transaction and passes the collateral on to the CCP may recognise that collateral to reduce its exposure to the client for that CCP-related transaction.In the case of a multi-level client structure, the treatment set out in the first subparagraph may be applied at each level of that structure.


# Article 305

**Treatment of clients' exposures**

*Article 305*


**1.** An institution that is a client shall calculate the own funds requirements for its CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Sections 1 to 8 of this Chapter, with Section 4 of Chapter 4 of this Title and with Title VI, as applicable.


**2.** Without prejudice to the approach specified in paragraph 1, where an institution is a client, it may calculate the own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306 provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the positions and assets of that institution related to those transactions are distinguished and segregated, at the level of both the clearing member and the CCP, from the positions and assets of both the clearing member and the other clients of that clearing member and as a result of that distinction and segregation those positions and assets are bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of the clearing member or one or more of its other clients;
- (b)laws, regulations, rules and contractual arrangements applicable to or binding that institution or the CCP facilitate the transfer of the client's positions relating to those contracts and transactions and of the corresponding collateral to another clearing member within the applicable margin period of risk in the event of default or insolvency of the original clearing member. In such circumstance, the client's positions and the collateral shall be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value;
- (c)the client has conducted a sufficiently thorough legal review, which it has kept up to date, that substantiates that the arrangements that ensure that the condition set out in point (b) is met are legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the relevant laws of the relevant jurisdiction or jurisdictions;
- (d)the CCP is a QCCP.When assessing its compliance with the condition set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph, an institution may take into account any clear precedents of transfers of client positions and of corresponding collateral at a CCP, and any industry intent to continue with that practice.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, where an institution that is a client fails to meet the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph because that institution is not protected from losses in case the clearing member and another client of the clearing member jointly default, provided that all the other conditions set out in points (a) to (d) of that paragraph are met, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306, subject to replacing the 2 % risk weight set out in point (a) of Article 306(1) with a 4 % risk weight.


**4.** In the case of a multi-level client structure, an institution that is a lower-level client accessing the services of a CCP through a higher-level client may apply the treatment set out in paragraph 2 or 3 only where the conditions set out therein are met at every level of that structure.


# Article 306

**Own funds requirements for trade exposures**

*Article 306*


**1.** An institution shall apply the following treatment to its trade exposures with CCPs:
- (a)it shall apply a risk weight of 2 % to the exposure values of all its trade exposures with QCCPs;
- (b)it shall apply the risk weight used for the Standardised Approach to credit risk as set out in Article 107(2)(b) to all its trade exposures with non-qualifying CCPs;
- (c)where an institution acts as a financial intermediary between a client and a CCP, and the terms of the CCP-related transaction stipulate that the institution is not required to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due to changes in the value of that transaction in the event that the CCP defaults, that institution may set the exposure value of the trade exposure with the CCP that corresponds to that CCP-related transaction to zero;
- (d)where an institution acts as a financial intermediary between a client and a CCP, and the terms of the CCP-related transaction stipulate that the institution is required to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due to changes in the value of that transaction in the event that the CCP defaults, that institution shall apply the treatment in point (a) or (b), as applicable, to the trade exposure with the CCP that corresponds to that CCP-related transaction.


**2.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where assets posted as collateral to a CCP or a clearing member are bankruptcy remote in the event that the CCP, the clearing member or one or more of the other clients of the clearing member become insolvent, an institution may attribute an exposure value of zero to the counterparty credit risk exposures for those assets.


**3.** An institution shall calculate exposure values of its trade exposures with a CCP in accordance with Sections 1 to 8 of this Chapter and with Section 4 of Chapter 4, as applicable.


**4.** An institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for its trade exposures with CCPs for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the sum of the exposure values of its trade exposures with CCPs, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, multiplied by the risk weight determined in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.

  where:
- **ILDC**: = the interest, leases and dividend component;
- **IC**: = the interest component, which is the institution’s interest income from all financial assets and other interest income, including finance income from financial leases and income from operating leases and profits from leased assets, minus the institution’s interest expenses from all financial liabilities and other interest expenses, including interest expense from financial and operating leases, depreciation and impairment of, and losses from, operating leased assets, calculated as the annual average of the absolute values of the differences over the last three financial years;
- **AC**: = the asset component, which is the sum of the institution’s total gross outstanding loans, advances, interest bearing securities, including government bonds, and lease assets, calculated as the annual average over the last three financial years on the basis of the amounts at the end of each of the respective financial years;
- **DC**: = the dividend component, which is the institution’s dividend income from investments in stocks and funds not consolidated in the financial statements of the institution, including dividend income from non-consolidated subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, calculated as the annual average over the last three financial years.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2, an EU parent institution may, until 31 December 2027, request permission from its consolidating supervisor to calculate a separate interest, leases and dividend component for any of its specific subsidiary institutions and to add the outcome of that calculation to the interest, leases and dividend component calculated, on a consolidated basis, for the other entities of the group where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the subsidiaries’ retail or commercial banking activities account for the majority of their activity;
- (b)a significant proportion of the subsidiaries’ retail or commercial banking activities comprise loans associated with a high PD;

**4.** Institutions shall also collect:
- (a)information about the reference dates of operational risk events, including:(i)the date when the operational risk event happened or first began ("date of occurrence"), where available;(ii)the date on which the institution became aware of the operational risk event ("date of discovery");(iii)the date or dates on which an operational risk event results in a loss, or the reserve or provision against a loss, recognised in the institution’s profit and loss accounts ("date of accounting");
- (b)information on any recoveries of gross loss amounts as well as descriptive information about the drivers or causes of the loss events.The level of detail of any descriptive information shall be commensurate with the size of the gross loss amount.


**5.** An institution shall not include in the loss data set operational risk events related to credit risk that are accounted for in the risk-weighted exposure amount for credit risk. Operational risk events that relate to credit risk but are not accounted for in the risk-weighted exposure amount for credit risk shall be included in the loss data set.


**6.** Operational risk events related to market risk shall be treated as operational risk and shall be included in the loss data set.


**7.** An institution shall, upon request from the competent authority, be able to map its historical internal loss data to the event type.

# Article 318

**Calculation of net loss and gross loss**

*Article 318*


**1.** For the purposes of Article 316(1), institutions shall calculate for each operational risk event a net loss as follows:
*net loss = gross loss – recovery*where:
- **gross loss**: = a loss linked to an operational risk event before recoveries of any type;
- **recovery**: = one or multiple independent occurrences, related to the original operational risk event, separated in time, in which funds or inflows of economic benefits are received from a third party.Institutions shall maintain on an ongoing basis an updated calculation of the net loss for each specific operational risk event. To that end, institutions shall update the net loss calculation based on the observed or estimated variations of the gross loss and the recovery for each of the last 10 financial years. Where losses, linked to the same operational risk event, are observed during multiple financial years within that 10-year time window, the institution shall calculate and maintain updated:
- (a)the net loss, gross loss and recovery for each of the financial years of the 10-year time window where that net loss, gross loss and recovery were recorded;
- (b)the aggregated net loss, aggregated gross loss and aggregated recovery of all relevant financial years of the 10-year time window.


**2.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, the following items shall be included in the gross loss computation:
- (a)direct charges, such as impairments, settlements, amounts paid to make good the damage, penalties and interest in arrears and legal fees, to the institution’s profit and loss accounts and write-downs due to the operational risk event, including:(i)where the operational risk event relates to market risk, the costs to unwind market positions in the recorded loss amount of the operational risk items;(ii)where payments relate to failures or inadequate processes of the institution, penalties, interest charges, late-payment charges, legal fees and, with the exclusion of the tax amount originally due, tax, unless that amount is already included under point (e);
- (b)costs incurred as a consequence of the operational risk event, including external expenses with a direct link to the operational risk event and costs of repair or replacement, incurred to restore the position that was prevailing before the operational risk event occurred;
- (c)provisions or reserves accounted for in the profit and loss accounts against the potential operational loss impact, including those from misconduct events;
- (d)losses stemming from operational risk events with a definitive financial impact which are temporarily booked in transitory or suspense accounts and are not yet reflected in the profit and loss accounts ("pending losses");
- (e)negative economic impacts booked in a financial year and which are due to operational risk events impacting the cash flows or financial statements of previous financial years ("timing losses").For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), material pending losses shall be included in the loss data set within a time period commensurate with the size and age of the pending item.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (e), the institution shall include in the loss data set material timing losses where those losses are due to operational risk events that span more than one financial year. Institutions shall include in the recorded loss amount of the operational risk item of a financial year losses that are due to the correction of booking errors that occurred in any previous financial year, even where those losses do not directly affect third parties. Where there are material timing losses and the operational risk event affects directly third parties, including customers, providers and employees of the institution, the institution shall also include the official restatement of previously issued financial reports.


**3.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, the following items shall be excluded from the gross loss computation:
- (a)costs of general maintenance of contracts on property, plant or equipment;
- (b)internal or external expenditure to enhance the business after the operational risk losses, including upgrades, improvements, risk assessment initiatives and enhancements;
- (c)insurance premiums.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, recoveries shall be used to reduce gross losses only where the institution has received payment. Receivables shall not be considered as recoveries.Upon request from the competent authority, the institution shall provide all documentation needed to verify the payments received and factored in the calculation of the net loss of an operational risk event.

**1.** To calculate the annual operational risk loss referred to in Article 316(1), institutions shall take into account from the loss data set operational risk events with a net loss, calculated in accordance with Article 318, that are equal to or exceed EUR 20 000.


**2.** Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article, and for the purposes of Article 446, institutions shall also calculate the annual operational risk loss referred to in Article 316(1), taking into account from the loss data set operational risk events with a net loss, calculated in accordance with Article 318, that are equal to or exceed EUR 100 000.


**3.** In the case of an operational risk event that leads to losses during more than one financial year, as referred to in Article 318(1), second subparagraph, the net loss to be taken into account for the thresholds referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be the aggregated net loss.


# Article 320

**Exclusion of losses**

*Article 320*


**1.** An institution may request permission from the competent authority to exclude from the calculation of its annual operational risk loss exceptional operational risk events that are no longer relevant to the institution’s risk profile, where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the cause of the operational risk event at the origin of those operational risk losses will not occur again;
- (b)the aggregated net loss of the corresponding operational risk event is either of the following:(i)equal to or exceed 10 % of the institution’s average annual operational risk loss, calculated over the last 10 financial years and based on the threshold referred to in Article 319(1), where the operational risk loss event refers to activities that are still part of the business indicator;(ii)related to an operational risk event that refers to activities divested from the business indicator in accordance with Article 315(2);
- (c)the operational risk loss was in the loss database for a minimum period of one year, unless the operational risk loss is related to activities divested from the business indicator in accordance with Article 315(2).For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), of this paragraph the minimum period of one year shall start from the date on which the operational risk event, included in the loss data set, first became greater than the materiality threshold provided for in Article 319(1).


**2.** An institution requesting the permission referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide the competent authority with documented justifications for the exclusion of an exceptional operational risk event, including:
- (a)a description of the operational risk event;
- (b)proof that the loss from the operational risk event is above the materiality threshold for loss exclusion referred to in paragraph 1, point (b)(i), including the date on which that operational risk event became greater than the materiality threshold;
- (c)the date on which the operational risk event concerned would be excluded, considering the minimum retention period set out in paragraph 1, point (c);
- (d)the reason why the operational risk event is no longer deemed relevant to the institution’s risk profile;
- (e)a demonstration that there are no similar or residual legal exposures and that the operational risk event to be excluded has no relevance to other activities or products;
- (f)reports of the institution’s independent review or validation, confirming that the operational risk event is no longer relevant and that there are no similar or residual legal exposures;
- (g)proof that competent bodies of the institution, through the institution’s approval processes, have approved the request for exclusion of the operational risk event and the date of such approval;
- (h)the impact of the exclusion of the operational risk event on the annual operational risk loss.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions that the competent authority has to assess pursuant to paragraph 1, including how the average annual operational risk loss is to be computed and the specifications on the information to be collected pursuant to paragraph 2 or any further information deemed necessary to carry out the assessment.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 January 2027.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

# Article 325

**Approaches for calculating the own funds requirements for market risk**

*Article 325*


**1.** An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for all its trading book positions and all its non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk in accordance with the following approaches:
- (a)the alternative standardised approach set out in Chapter 1a;
- (b)the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b for those positions assigned to trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission by its competent authority to use that alternative approach as set out in Article 325az(1);
- (c)the simplified standardised approach referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, provided that the institution meets the conditions set out in Article 325a(1).By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution shall not calculate own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk for trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk where those positions are deducted from the institution’s own funds. The institution shall document its use of the derogation set out in this subparagraph, including its impact and materiality, and make the information available, upon request, to its competent authority.


**2.** The own funds requirements for market risk calculated in accordance with the simplified standardised approach shall be the sum of the following own funds requirements, as applicable:
- (a)the own funds requirements for position risk referred to in Chapter 2, multiplied by:(i)1,3, for the general and specific risks of positions in debt instruments, excluding securitisation instruments as referred to in Article 337;(ii)3,5, for the general and specific risks of positions in equity instruments;
- (b)the own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk referred to in Chapter 3, multiplied by 1,2;
- (c)the own funds requirements for commodity risk referred to in Chapter 4, multiplied by 1,9;
- (d)the own funds requirements for securitisation instruments as referred to in Article 337.


**3.** An institution using the alternative internal model approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk shall report to its competent authority the monthly calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk using the alternative standardised approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article for each trading desk to which those positions have been assigned in accordance with Article 104b.


**4.** An institution may use a combination of the alternative standardised approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article and the alternative internal model approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article on a permanent basis, provided that the total own funds requirements for market risk calculated using the alternative internal model approach represent at least 10 % of the total own funds requirements for market risk. On an individual basis, an institution shall not use either of those approaches in combination with the simplified standardised approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (c), of this Article. At consolidated level, an institution may use a combination of those three approaches to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 325b(4), point (b), as long as the simplified standardised approach is not used in combination with the other two approaches within a single legal entity.


**5.** An institution shall not use the alternative internal model approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), for instruments in its trading book that are securitisation positions or positions included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP) set out in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8.


**6.** Securitisation positions and nth-to-default credit derivatives that meet all the following criteria shall be included in the ACTP:
- (a)the positions are neither re-securitisation positions, nor options on a securitisation tranche, nor any other derivatives of securitisation exposures that do not provide a pro-rata share in the proceeds of a securitisation tranche;
- (b)all their underlying instruments are:(i)single-name instruments, including single-name credit derivatives, for which a liquid two-way market exists;(ii)commonly-traded indices based on the instruments referred to in point (i).A two-way market is considered to exist where there are independent bona fide offers to buy and sell, so that a price that is reasonably related to the last sales price or current bona fide competitive bid and offer quotations can be determined within one day and settled at that price within a relatively short time conforming to trade custom.


**7.** Positions with any of the following underlying instruments shall not be included in the ACTP:
- (a)underlying instruments that are assigned to the exposure classes referred to in point (h) or (i) of Article 112;
- (b)a claim on a special purpose entity, collateralised, directly or indirectly, by a position that, in accordance with paragraph 6, would itself not be eligible for inclusion in the ACTP.


**8.** Institutions may include in the ACTP positions that are neither securitisation positions nor nth-to-default credit derivatives but that hedge other positions in that portfolio, provided that a liquid two-way market as described in the second subparagraph of paragraph 6 exists for the instrument or its underlying instruments.


**9.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions are to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), of this Article, taking into account the requirements set out in Article 104b(5) and (6), where applicable.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 325a

**Conditions for using the simplified standardised approach**

*Article 325A*


**1.** An institution may calculate the own funds requirements for market risk by using the simplified standardised approach referred to in Article 325(1), point (c), provided that the size of the institution’s on- and off-balance-sheet business that is subject to market risk is equal to or less than each of the following thresholds, on the basis of an assessment carried out on a monthly basis using data as of the last day of the month:
- (a)10 % of the institution's total assets;
- (b)EUR 500 million.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the size of their on- and off-balance-sheet business that is subject to market risk using data as of the last day of each month in accordance with the following requirements:

- (b)all non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk shall be included, except those positions that are excluded from the calculation of the own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk in accordance with Article 104c or that are deducted from the institutions’ own funds;
- (c)all positions shall be valued at their market values on that date, except for positions referred to in point (b); where the market value of a trading book position is not available on a given date, institutions shall take a fair value for the trading book position on that date; where the fair value and market value of a trading book position are not available on a given date, institutions shall take the most recent market value or fair value for that position;
- (d)all non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk shall be considered as an overall net foreign exchange position and valued in accordance with Article 352;
- (e)all the non-trading book positions that are subject to commodity risk shall be valued in accordance with Articles 357 and 358;
- (f)the absolute value of the aggregated long position shall be summed with the absolute value of the aggregated short position.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the meaning of long and short positions is the same as the meaning set out in Article 94(3).For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the value of the aggregated long (short) position shall be equal to the sum of the values of the individual long (short) positions included in the calculation in accordance with points (a) and (b) of that subparagraph.


**3.** Institutions shall notify the competent authorities when they calculate, or cease to calculate, their own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with this Article.


**4.** An institution that no longer meets one or more of the conditions set out in paragraph 1 shall immediately notify the competent authority thereof.

- (b)the institution does not meet the condition set out in point (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 during more than 6 out of the last 12 months.


**6.** An institution that has ceased to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk using the approach referred to in Article 325(1), point (c), shall only be permitted to start calculating the own funds requirements for market risk using that approach where it demonstrates to the competent authority that all of the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article have been met for an uninterrupted period of one year.


**7.** Institutions shall not enter into, buy or sell a position only for the purpose of complying with any of the conditions set out in paragraph 1 during the monthly assessment.


**8.** An institution that is eligible for the treatment set out in Article 94 shall be exempted from the reporting requirement set out in Article 430b.


# Article 325b

**Permission for consolidated requirements**

*Article 325B*


**1.** Subject to paragraph 2, and only for the purpose of calculating net positions and own funds requirements in accordance with this Title on a consolidated basis, institutions may use positions in one institution or undertaking to offset positions in another institution or undertaking.


**2.** Institutions may apply paragraph 1 only with the permission of the competent authorities which shall be granted if all the following conditions are met:
- (a)there is a satisfactory allocation of own funds within the group;
- (b)the regulatory, legal or contractual framework in which the institutions operate guarantees mutual financial support within the group.


**3.** Where there are undertakings located in third countries, all the following conditions shall be met in addition to those set out in paragraph 2:

**4.** Where a competent authority has not granted an institution the permission referred to in paragraph 2 for at least one institution or undertaking of the group, the following requirements shall apply for the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk on a consolidated basis in accordance with this Title:
- (a)the institution shall calculate net positions and own funds requirements in accordance with this Title for all positions in institutions or undertakings of the group for which the institution has been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 2, using the treatment set out in paragraph 1;
- (b)the institution shall calculate net positions and own funds requirements in accordance with this Title individually for all positions in each institution or undertaking of the group for which the institution has not been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 2;
- (c)the institution shall calculate the total own funds requirements in accordance with this Title on a consolidated basis by adding the amounts calculated in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph.For the purposes of the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), institutions and undertakings referred to therein shall use the same reporting currency as the reporting currency used to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with this Title on a consolidated basis for the group.


# Article 325c

**Scope, structure and qualitative requirements of the alternative standardised approach**

*Article 325C*


**1.** Institutions shall have in place, and make available to the competent authorities, a documented set of internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. Any changes to those policies, procedures and controls shall be notified to the competent authorities in due course.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the alternative standardised approach for a portfolio of trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange or commodity risk as the sum of the following three components:
- (a)the own funds requirement under the sensitivities-based method set out in Section 2;
- (b)the own funds requirement for the default risk set out in Section 5 which is only applicable to the trading book positions referred to in that Section;
- (c)the own funds requirement for residual risks set out in Section 4 which is only applicable to the trading book positions referred to in that Section.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2, an institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the alternative standardised approach for the institution’s holdings of its own debt instruments as the sum of the two components referred to in paragraph 2, points (a) and (c). When calculating the own funds requirements for market risk for own debt instruments under the sensitivities-based method referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), the institution shall exclude from that calculation the risks from the institution’s own credit spread.


**4.** Institutions shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and that reports directly to senior management. That risk control unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing the alternative standardised approach. It shall produce and analyse monthly reports on the output of the alternative standardised approach, as well as the appropriateness of the institution’s trading limits.


**5.** Institutions shall independently review the alternative standardised approach they use for the purposes of this Chapter to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, either as part of their regular internal auditing process, or by mandating a third-party undertaking to conduct that review. The outcome of such a review shall be reported to the appropriate management bodies.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, "third-party undertaking" means an undertaking that provides auditing or consulting services to institutions and that has staff with sufficient skills in the area of market risk.


**6.** The review of the alternative standardised approach referred to in paragraph 5 shall cover the activities of both the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit and shall assess at least the following:
- (a)the internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article;
- (b)the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and processes and the organisation of the risk control unit referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article;
- (c)the accuracy of sensitivity computations and of the process used to derive those computations from the institution’s pricing models that serve as a basis for reporting profit and loss to senior management, as referred to in Article 325t;
- (d)the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of the data sources used in the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk using the alternative standardised approach, including the independence of those data sources.An institution shall conduct the review referred to in the first subparagraph at least once a year, or on a less frequent basis of up to every two years where the institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the size, systemic importance, nature, scale and complexity of its trading book business justifies a less frequent review.


**7.** Competent authorities shall verify that the calculation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, including the implementation by an institution of the requirements set out in this Chapter and in Article 325a, is performed with integrity.


**8.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the assessment methodology under which competent authorities conduct the verification referred to in paragraph 7;EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2028.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 325d

**Definitions**

*Article 325D*

For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions apply:
- (1)"risk class" means one of the following seven categories:
- (i)general interest rate risk;
- (ii)credit spread risk (CSR) for non-securitisation;
- (iii)credit spread risk for securitisation not included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (non-ACTP CSR);
- (iv)credit spread risk for securitisation included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP CSR);
- (v)equity risk;
- (vi)commodity risk;
- (vii)foreign exchange risk;
- (2)"sensitivity" means the relative change in the value of a position, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of the position, calculated with the institution's pricing model in accordance with Subsection 2 of Section 3;
- (3)"bucket" means a sub-category of positions within one risk class with a similar risk profile to which a risk weight as defined in Subsection 1 of Section 3 is assigned.
# Article 325e

**Components of the sensitivities-based method**

*Article 325E*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for market risk under the sensitivities-based method by aggregating the following three own funds requirements in accordance with Article 325h:
- (a)own funds requirements for delta risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its non-volatility related risk factors;
- (b)own funds requirements for vega risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its volatility-related risk factors;
- (c)own funds requirements for curvature risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in the main non-volatility related risk factors not captured by the own funds requirements for delta risk.


**2.** For the purpose of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1,
- (a)all the positions of instruments with optionality shall be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 for the risks other than exotic underlyings of the instruments as referred to in point (a) of Article 325u(2);
- (b)all the positions of instruments without optionality shall be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 for the risks other than exotic underlyings of the instruments as referred to in point (a) of Article 325u(2).For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments with optionality include, among others: calls, puts, caps, floors, swap options, barrier options and exotic options. Embedded options, such as prepayment or behavioural options, shall be considered to be stand-alone positions in options for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk.For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of the underlying's notional amount shall be considered to be instruments without optionality.


**3.** By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 2, an institution may choose to subject all the positions of instruments without optionality to the own funds requirements referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1.An institution that chooses to use the approach set out in the first subparagraph shall notify its competent authority thereof at least three months before the first use. After those three months have elapsed and provided that the competent authority has not objected, the institution may use that approach until the competent authority informs the institution that it is no longer permitted to do so.An institution that wishes to stop using the approach set out in the first subparagraph shall notify its competent authority thereof at least three months before stopping that use. The institution may stop applying that approach, unless the competent authority has objected within that three-month period.


# Article 325f

**Own funds requirements for delta and vega risks**

*Article 325F*


**1.** Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in Subsection 1 of Section 3 to calculate the own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.


**2.** Institutions shall apply the process set out in paragraphs 3 to 8 to calculate own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.


**3.** For each risk class, the sensitivity of all instruments in scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risks to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulas in Subsection 2 of Section 3. If the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor.


**4.** Sensitivities shall be assigned to one of the buckets "b" within each risk class.


**5.** Within each bucket "b", the positive and negative sensitivities to the same risk factor shall be netted, giving rise to net sensitivities (sk) to each risk factor k within a bucket.


**6.** The net sensitivities to each risk factor within each bucket shall be multiplied by the corresponding risk weights set out in Section 6, giving rise to weighted sensitivities to each risk factor within that bucket in accordance with the following formula:
- WSk = RWk · skwhere:
- **WSk**=the weighted sensitivities;
- **RWk**=the risk weights; and
- **sk**=the risk factor.


**7.** The weighted sensitivities to the different risk factors within each bucket shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, where the quantity within the square root function is floored at zero, giving rise to the bucket-specific sensitivity. The corresponding correlations for weighted sensitivities within the same bucket (ρkl), set out in Section 6, shall be used.
- 
$$K
_{b} = 
\sum
_{k} WS
^{2}
_{k} + 
\sum
_{k}
\sum
_{kNEl} ρ
_{kl}WS
_{k}WS
_{l}$$
where:
- **Kb**=the bucket-specific sensitivity; and

**8.** The bucket-specific sensitivity shall be calculated for each bucket within a risk class in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7. Once the bucket-specific sensitivity has been calculated for all buckets, weighted sensitivities to all risk factors across buckets shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, using the corresponding correlations γbc for weighted sensitivities in different buckets set out in Section 6, giving rise to the risk-class specific own funds requirement for delta or vega risk:

*Article 325H*


**1.** Institutions shall aggregate risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks in accordance with the process set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.


**2.** The process to calculate the risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks described in Articles 325f and 325g shall be performed three times per risk class, each time using a different set of correlation parameters ρkl (correlation between risk factors within a bucket) and γbc (correlation between buckets within a risk class). Each of those three sets shall correspond to a different scenario, as follows:
- (a)the medium correlations scenario, whereby the correlation parameters ρkl and γbc remain unchanged from those specified in Section 6;

# Article 325i

**Treatment of index instruments and other multi-underlying instruments**

*Article 325I*


**1.** Institutions shall use a look-through approach for index and other multi-underlying instruments in accordance with the following:
- (a)for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements for delta and curvature risk, institutions shall consider that they hold individual positions directly in the underlying constituents of the index or other multi-underlying instruments, except for a position in an index included in the ACTP for which they shall calculate a single sensitivity to the index;
- (b)institutions are allowed to net the sensitivities to a risk factor of a given constituent of an index instrument or other multi-underlying instrument with the sensitivities to the same risk factor of the same constituent of single name instruments, except for positions included in the ACTP;
- (c)for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements for vega risk, institutions may either consider that they directly hold individual positions in the underlying constituents of the index or other multi-underlying instrument, or calculate a single sensitivity to the underlying of that instrument. In the latter case, institutions shall assign the single sensitivity to the relevant bucket as set out in Subsection 1 of Section 6 as follows:(i)where, taking into account the weightings of that index, more than 75 % of constituents in that index would be mapped to the same bucket, institutions shall assign the sensitivity to that bucket and treat it as a single-name sensitivity in that bucket;(ii)in all other cases, institutions shall assign the sensitivity to the relevant index bucket.


**2.** By way of derogation from point (a) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate a single sensitivity to a position in a listed equity or credit index for the purposes of calculating the own funds requirements for delta and curvature risks provided the listed equity or credit index meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3. In that case, institutions shall assign the single sensitivity to the relevant bucket as set out in Subsection 1 of Section 6 as follows:
- (a)where, taking into account the weightings of that listed index, more than 75 % of constituents in that listed index would be mapped to the same bucket, that sensitivity shall be assigned to that bucket and treated as a single-name sensitivity in that bucket;
- (b)in all other cases, institutions shall assign the sensitivity to the relevant listed index bucket.


**3.** Institutions may use the approach set out in paragraph 2 for instruments referencing a listed equity or credit index where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the constituents of the listed index and their respective weightings in that index are known;
- (b)the listed index contains at least 20 constituents;
- (c)no single constituent contained within the listed index represents more than 25 % of the total market capitalisation of that index;
- (d)no set comprising one tenth of the total number of constituents of the listed index, rounded up to the next integer, represents more than 60 % of the total market capitalisation of that index;
- (e)the total market capitalisation of all the constituents of the listed index is no less than EUR 40 billion.


**4.** An institution shall use, consistently over time, only the approach set out in paragraph 1 or the approach set out in paragraph 2 for all the instruments that reference a listed equity or credit index that meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3. An institution shall require prior permission from the competent authority before switching from one approach to another.


**5.** For an index or other multi-underlying instrument, the sensitivity inputs for the calculation of delta and curvature risks shall be consistent, irrespective of the approaches used for that instrument.


**6.** Index or multi-underlying instruments which bear other residual risks as referred to in Article 325u(5) shall be subject to the residual risk add-on referred to in Section 4.


# Article 325j

**Treatment of collective investment undertakings**

*Article 325J*


**1.** An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a position in a CIU using one of the following approaches:
- (a)an institution that meets the condition set out in Article 104(8), point (a), shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of that position by looking through the underlying positions of the CIU, on a monthly basis, as if those positions were directly held by the institution;
- (b)an institution that meets the condition set out in Article 104(8), point (b), shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of that position by using either of the following approaches:(i)it shall consider the position in the CIU as a single equity position allocated to the bucket "other sector" in Article 325ap(1), Table 8;(ii)it shall consider the limits set in the CIU’s mandate and in the relevant law.For the purposes of the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph, point (b)(ii), of this paragraph the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk and own funds requirements for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative positions of the CIU using the simplified approach set out in Article 132a(3).


**1a.** For the purposes of the approaches referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article the institution shall:
- (a)apply the own funds requirements for default risk set out in Section 5 and the residual risk add-on set out in Section 4 to a position in a CIU, where the mandate of that CIU allows it to invest in exposures that shall be subject to those own funds requirements; when using the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b)(i), of this Article the institution shall consider the position in the CIU as a single unrated equity position allocated to the bucket "unrated" in Article 325y(1), Table 2; and
- (b)for all positions in the same CIU, use the same approach among the approaches set out in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article to calculate the own funds requirements on a stand-alone basis as a separate portfolio.


**2.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where an institution has a position in a CIU that tracks an index benchmark so that the annualised return difference between the CIU and the tracked index benchmark over the last 12 months is below 1 % in absolute terms, ignoring fees and commissions, the institution may treat that position as a position in the tracked index benchmark. An institution shall verify compliance with that condition when the institution enters into the position and, after that, at least annually.However, where data for the last 12 months are not fully available, an institution may, subject to permission from the institution’s competent authority, use an annualised return difference from a period shorter than 12 months.


**3.** An institution may use a combination of the approaches referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), for its positions in CIUs. However, an institution shall use only one of those approaches for all positions in the same CIU.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (b)(ii), of this Article an institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk by determining the hypothetical portfolio of the CIU that would attract the highest own funds requirements in accordance with Article 325c(2), point (a), based on the CIU’s mandate or relevant law, taking into account the leverage to the maximum extent, where applicable.The institution shall use the same hypothetical portfolio as the one referred to in the first subparagraph to calculate, where applicable, the own funds requirements for default risk set out in Section 5 and the residual risk add-on set out in Section 4 to a position in a CIU.The methodology developed by the institution to determine the hypothetical portfolios of all positions in CIUs for which the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph are used shall be approved by its competent authority.


**5.** An institution may use the approaches referred to in paragraph 1 only where the CIU meets all of the conditions set out in Article 132(3). Where the CIU does not meet all of the conditions set out in Article 132(3), the institution shall assign its positions in that CIU to the non-trading book.


**6.** To calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a CIU position in accordance with the approach set out in paragraph 1, point (a), institutions may rely on a third party to perform such calculation, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the third party is one of the following:(i)the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;(ii)for CIUs not covered by point (i) of this point, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3), point (a);(iii)a third-party vendor on condition that the data, information or risk metrics are provided or calculated by the third parties referred to in point (i) or (ii) of this point or by another such third-party vendor;
- (b)the third party provides the institution with the data, information or risk metrics to calculate the own funds requirement for market risk of the CIU position in accordance with the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article;
- (c)an external auditor of the institution has confirmed the adequacy of the third-party’s data, information or risk metrics referred to in point (b) of this paragraph and the institution’s competent authority has unrestricted access to those data, information or risk metrics upon request.


**7.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the technical elements of the methodology to determine hypothetical portfolios for the purposes of the approach set out in paragraph 4, including the manner in which institutions are to take into account in the methodology, where applicable, leverage to the maximum extent.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 January 2027.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

# Article 325l

**General interest rate risk factors**

*Article 325L*


**1.** For all general interest rate risk factors, including inflation risk and cross-currency basis risk, there shall be one bucket per currency, each containing different types of risk factor.The delta general interest rate risk factors applicable to interest rate-sensitive instruments shall be the relevant risk-free rates per currency and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall assign risk factors to the specified vertices by linear interpolation or by using a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the independent risk control function of the institution to report market risk or profits and losses to senior management.


**2.** Institutions shall obtain the risk-free rates per currency from money market instruments held in the trading book of the institution that have the lowest credit risk, such as overnight index swaps.


**3.** Where institutions cannot apply the approach referred to in paragraph 2, the risk-free rates shall be based on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark positions to market, such as the interbank offered rate swap curves.Where the data on market-implied swap curves described in paragraph 2 and the first subparagraph of this paragraph are insufficient, the risk-free rates may be derived from the most appropriate sovereign bond curve for a given currency.Where institutions use the general interest rate risk factors derived in accordance with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph for sovereign debt instruments, the sovereign debt instrument shall not be exempted from the own funds requirements for credit spread risk. In those cases, where it is not possible to disentangle the risk-free rate from the credit spread component, the sensitivity to the risk factor shall be allocated both to the general interest rate risk and to credit spread risk classes.


**4.** In the case of general interest rate risk factors, each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Institutions shall assign risk factors within the same bucket, but with different maturities, a different risk weight, in accordance with Section 6.Institutions shall apply additional risk factors for inflation risk to debt instruments whose cash flows are functionally dependent on inflation rates. Those additional risk factors shall consist of one vector of market-implied inflation rates of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are inflation rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.


**5.** Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the additional risk factor for inflation risk referred to in paragraph 4 as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket, institutions shall treat inflation as a single risk factor, regardless of the number of components of each vector. Institutions shall offset all sensitivities to inflation within a bucket, calculated as described in this paragraph, in order to give rise to a single net sensitivity per bucket.


**6.** Debt instruments that involve payments in different currencies shall also be subject to cross-currency basis risk between those currencies. For the purposes of the sensitivities-based method, the risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be the cross-currency basis risk of each currency over either US dollar or euro. Institutions shall compute cross currency bases that do not relate to either basis over US dollar or basis over euro either on "basis over US dollar" or "basis over euro".Each cross-currency basis risk factor shall consist of one vector of cross-currency basis of different maturities per currency. For each debt instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are cross-currency bases used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket.Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the cross-currency basis risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket there shall be two possible distinct risk factors: basis over euro and basis over US dollar, regardless of the number of components there are in each cross-currency basis vector. The maximum number of net sensitivities per bucket shall be two.


**7.** The vega general interest rate risk factors applicable to options with underlyings that are sensitive to general interest rate shall be the implied volatilities of the relevant risk-free rates as described in paragraphs 2 and 3, which shall be assigned to buckets depending on the currency and mapped to the following maturities within each bucket: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be one bucket per currency.For netting purposes, institutions shall consider implied volatilities linked to the same risk-free rates and mapped to the same maturities to constitute the same risk factor.Where institutions map implied volatilities to the maturities as referred to in this paragraph, the following requirements shall apply:
- (a)where the maturity of the option is aligned with the maturity of the underlying, a single risk factor shall be considered, which shall be mapped to that maturity;
- (b)where the maturity of the option is shorter than the maturity of the underlying, the following risk factors shall be considered as follows:(i)the first risk factor shall be mapped to the maturity of the option;(ii)the second risk factor shall be mapped to the residual maturity of the underlying of the option at the expiry date of the option.


**8.** The curvature general interest rate risk factors to be applied by institutions shall consist of one vector of risk-free rates, representing a specific risk-free yield curve, per currency. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of risk-free rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.


**9.** Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors corresponding to different yield curves and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same currency. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the same risk factor. There shall be only one net sensitivity per bucket.There shall be no curvature risk own funds requirements for inflation and cross currency basis risks.


# Article 325m

**Credit spread risk factors for non-securitisation**

*Article 325M*


**1.** The delta credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the issuer credit spread rates of those instruments, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and mapped to each of the following maturities: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall apply one risk factor per issuer and maturity, regardless of whether those issuer credit spread rates are inferred from debt instruments or credit default swaps. The buckets shall be sector buckets, as referred to in Section 6, and each bucket shall include all the risk factors allocated to the relevant sector.


**2.** The vega credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with non-securitisation underlyings that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the implied volatilities of the underlying's issuer credit spread rates inferred as laid down in paragraph 1, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation.


**3.** The curvature credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments shall consist of one vector of credit spread rates, representing a credit spread curve specific to the issuer. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates used as variables in the institution's pricing model for that instrument. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred from either relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same issuer.

**2.** The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for securitisations that are included in the ACTP shall be the same as the buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for non-securitisations, as referred to in Section 6.The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for securitisations that are not included in the ACTP shall be specific to that risk-class category, as referred to in Section 6.


**3.** The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP are the following:
- (a)the delta risk factors shall be all the relevant credit spread rates of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and for each of the following maturities: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.
- (b)the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred as described in point (a) of this paragraph, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the corresponding option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.
- (c)the curvature risk factors shall be the relevant credit spread yield curves of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position expressed as a vector of credit spread rates for different maturities, inferred as indicated in point (a) of this paragraph; for each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the securitisation position to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula as specified in Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred either from relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same issuer.


**5.** The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP shall refer to the spread of the tranche rather than the spread of the underlying instruments and shall be the following:
- (a)the delta risk factors shall be the relevant tranche credit spread rates, mapped to the following maturities, in accordance with the maturity of the tranche: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years;
- (b)the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the tranches, each of them mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years;
- (c)the curvature risk factors shall be the same as those described in point (a) of this paragraph; to all those risk factors, a common risk weight shall be applied, as referred to in Section 6.


# Article 325o

*Article 325O*


**1.** The buckets for all equity risk factors shall be the sector buckets referred to in Section 6.


**2.** The equity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be all the equity spot prices and all equity repo rates.For the purposes of equity risk, a specific equity repo curve shall constitute a single risk factor, which is expressed as a vector of repo rates for different maturities. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of repo rates that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of an instrument to an equity risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the repo rate risk factor of the same equity security, regardless of the number of components of each vector.

Institutions shall only consider two commodity prices of the same type of commodity, and with the same maturity to constitute the same risk factor where the set of legal terms regarding the delivery location are identical.


**3.** The commodity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be the implied volatilities of commodity prices per commodity type, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall consider sensitivities to the same commodity type and allocated to the same maturity to be a single risk factor which institutions shall then offset.


**4.** The commodity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be one set of commodity prices with different maturities per commodity type, expressed as a vector. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are prices of that commodity that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Institutions shall not differentiate between commodity prices by delivery location.The sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula shall be calculated as specified in Article 325g. For the purposes of curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors having a different number of components to constitute the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same commodity type.

*[Formula: L_2021084EN.01000801.tif]*

   and

*[Formula: L_2021084EN.01000802.tif]*

   set out in paragraph 2 of Article 325g for which 
*xk* is the foreign exchange risk factor between one of the two currencies of the underlying and the institution’s reporting currency or the institution’s base currency, as applicable.


**6.** Subject to permission from its competent authority, an institution may divide by 1,5 the components 

*[Formula: L_2021084EN.01000803.tif]*

   and

*[Formula: L_2021084EN.01000804.tif]*

   set out in Article 325g(2) consistently for all the foreign exchange risk factors of instruments concerning foreign exchange and subject to own funds requirement for curvature risk, provided that any foreign exchange risk factors based on the institution’s reporting currency or the institution’s base currency, as applicable, that are included in the calculation of those components are shifted simultaneously.


**7.** By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 3, an institution may replace, subject to permission from its competent authority, its reporting currency by another currency ("the base currency") in all the spot exchange rates to express the delta and curvature foreign exchange risk factors where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution uses only one base currency;
- (b)the institution applies the base currency consistently to all its trading book and non-trading book positions;
- (c)the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of its competent authority that:(i)using the chosen base currency provides an appropriate risk representation for the institution’s positions subject to foreign exchange risks;(ii)the choice of base currency is compatible with the manner in which the institution manages those foreign exchange risks internally;(iii)the choice of base currency is not driven primarily by the desire to reduce the institution’s own funds requirements;
- (d)the institution takes into account the translation risk between the reporting currency and the base currency.An institution that has been permitted to use a base currency as set out in the first subparagraph shall convert the resulting own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk into the reporting currency using the prevailing spot exchange rate between the base currency and the reporting currency.

**4.** Institutions shall not calculate the vega risk for securitisation tranches included in the ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(6), (7) and (8), that do not have an implied volatility. Own funds requirements for delta and curvature risk shall be computed for those securitisation tranches.


# Article 325t

**Requirements on sensitivity computations**

*Article 325T*


**1.** Institutions shall derive sensitivities from the institution's pricing models that serve as a basis for reporting profit and loss to senior management, using the formulas set out in this Subsection.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, competent authorities may require an institution that has been granted permission to use the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b to use the pricing functions of the risk-measurement system of their internal model approach in the calculation of sensitivities under this Chapter for the purposes of the calculation and the reporting requirements set out in Article 325(3).


**2.** When calculating delta risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (a) of Article 325e(2), institutions may assume that the implied volatility risk factors remain constant.


**3.** When calculating vega risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (b) of Article 325e(2), the following requirements shall apply:
- (a)for general interest rate risk and credit spread risk, institutions shall assume, for each currency, that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows either a lognormal or normal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments;
- (b)for equity risk, commodity risk and foreign exchange risk, institutions shall assume that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows a lognormal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate all sensitivities except for the sensitivities to credit valuation adjustments.


**5.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, an institution may use alternative definitions of delta risk sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets all the following conditions:
- (a)those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes or for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;
- (b)the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities for the position than are the formulas set out in this Subsection, and that the resulting sensitivities do not materially differ from those formulas.


**6.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, an institution may calculate vega sensitivities on the basis of a linear transformation of alternative definitions of sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets both the following conditions:
- (a)those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes or for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;
- (b)the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities for the position than are the formulae set out in this Subsection, that the linear transformation referred to in the first subparagraph reflects a vega risk sensitivity, and that the resulting sensitivities do not materially differ from the ones applying those formulae.


# Article 325u

**Own funds requirements for residual risks**

*Article 325U*


**1.** In addition to the own funds requirements for market risk set out in Section 2, institutions shall apply additional own funds requirements to instruments exposed to residual risks in accordance with this Article.


**2.** Instruments are considered to be exposed to residual risks where they meet any of the following conditions:
- (a)the instrument references an exotic underlying, which, for the purposes of this Chapter, means a trading book instrument referencing an underlying exposure that is not in the scope of the delta, vega or curvature risk treatments under the sensitivities-based method laid down in Section 2 or the own funds requirements for the default risk set out in Section 5;
- (b)the instrument is an instrument bearing other residual risks, which, for the purposes of this Chapter, means any of the following instruments:(i)instruments that are subject to the own funds requirements for vega and curvature risk under the sensitivities-based method set out in Section 2 and that generate pay-offs that cannot be replicated as a finite linear combination of plain-vanilla options with a single underlying equity price, commodity price, exchange rate, bond price, credit default swap price or interest rate swap;(ii)instruments that are positions that are included in the ACTP referred to in Article 325(6); hedges that are included in that ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(8), shall not be considered.


**3.** Institutions shall calculate the additional own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 1 as the sum of gross notional amounts of the instruments referred to in paragraph 2, multiplied by the following risk weights:
- (a)1,0 % in the case of instruments referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2;
- (b)0,1 % in the case of instruments referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2.


**4.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institution shall not apply the own funds requirement for residual risks to an instrument that meets any of the following conditions:
- (a)the instrument is listed on a recognised exchange;
- (b)the instrument is eligible for central clearing in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;
- (c)the instrument perfectly offsets the market risk of another position in the trading book, in which case the two perfectly matching trading book positions shall be exempted from the own funds requirement for residual risks.


**4a.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, until 31 December 2032, an institution shall not apply the own funds requirement for residual risks to instruments that aim solely to hedge the market risk of positions in the trading book that generate an own funds requirement for residual risks and are subject to the same type of residual risks as the positions they hedge.The competent authority shall grant permission to apply the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph if the institution can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the instruments comply with the criteria to be treated as hedging positions.The institution shall report to the competent authority the result of the calculation of the own funds requirements for the residual risks for all instruments for which the derogation referred to in the first subparagraph is applied.


**5.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what an exotic underlying is and which instruments are instruments bearing residual risks for the purposes of paragraph 2.When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall examine whether longevity risk, weather, natural disasters and future realised volatility should be considered as exotic underlyings.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2021.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria that the institutions are to use to identify the positions qualifying for the derogation referred to in paragraph 4a. Those criteria shall include, at least, the nature of the instruments referred to in that paragraph, the net profit and loss of the combined positions, the sensitivities of the combined positions and the risks remaining unhedged in the combined positions, taking into account in particular the possibility that the original position can be hedged by a partial amount.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 June 2024.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**7.** By 31 December 2029, EBA shall submit a report to the Commission on the impact of the application of the treatment referred to in paragraph 4a. On the basis of the findings of that report, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal to prolong the treatment referred to in that paragraph.


# Article 325v

**Definitions and general provisions**

*Article 325V*


**1.** For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply:
- (a)"short exposure" means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a gain for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;
- (b)"long exposure" means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a loss for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;
- (c)"gross jump-to-default (gross JTD) amount" means the estimated size of the loss or gain that the default of the obligor would produce for a specific exposure;
- (d)"net jump-to-default (net JTD) amount" means the estimated size of the loss or gain that an institution would incur due to the default of an obligor, after offsetting between gross JTD amounts has taken place,
- (e)"loss given default" or "LGD" means the loss given default of the obligor on an instrument issued by that obligor expressed as a share of the notional amount of the instrument;
- (f)"default risk weight" means the percentage representing the estimated probability of the default of each obligor, according to the creditworthiness of that obligor.


**2.** Own funds requirements for the default risk shall apply to debt and equity instruments, to derivative instruments having those instruments as underlyings and to derivatives, the pay-offs or fair values of which are affected by the default of an obligor other than the counterparty to the derivative instrument itself. Institutions shall calculate default risk requirements separately for each of the following types of instruments: non-securitisations, securitisations that are not included in the ACTP, and securitisations that are included in the ACTP. The final own funds requirements for the default risk to be applied by institutions shall be the sum of those three components.


**3.** For traded non-securitisation credit and equity derivatives, JTD amounts by individual constituents shall be determined by applying a look-through approach.


# Article 325w

**Gross jump-to-default amounts**

*Article 325W*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each long exposure to debt instruments as follows:
- JTDlong = max {LGD Vnotional + P&Llong + Adjustmentlong; 0}where:
- **JTDlong**=the gross JTD amount for the long exposure;
- **Vnotional**=the notional amount of the instrument from which the exposure arises;
- **P&Llong**=a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the long exposure; gains shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and losses shall enter into the formula with a negative sign; and
- **Adjustmentlong**=where the instrument from which the exposure arises is a derivative instrument, the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's loss in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; increases shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and decreases shall enter into the formula with a negative sign.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each short exposure to debt instruments as follows:
- JTDshort = min {LGD Vnotional + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}where:
- **JTDshort**=the gross JTD amount for the short exposure;
- **Vnotional**=the notional amount of the instrument from which the exposure arises that shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;
- **P&Lshort**=a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the short exposure; gains shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and losses shall enter into the formula with a negative sign; and
- **Adjustmentshort**=where the instrument from which the exposure arises is a derivative instrument, the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's gain in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; decreases shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and increases shall enter into the formula with a negative sign.


**3.** For the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the LGD for debt instruments to be applied by institutions shall be the following:
- (a)exposures to non-senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 100 %;
- (b)exposures to senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 75 %;

- (a)in the case of a bond, the notional amount is the face value of the bond;
- (b)in the case of a sold put option on a bond, the notional amount is the notional amount of the option; in the case of a bought call option on a bond, the notional amount is 0.


**5.** For exposures to equity instruments, institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts as follows:JTDlong = max {LGD · Vnotional + P&Llong + Adjustmentlong; 0}JTDshort = min {LGD · Vnotional + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}where:
- **JTDlong**=the gross JTD amount for the long exposure;
- **Vnotional**=the notional amount of the instrument from which the exposure arises; the notional amount is the fair value of the equity for cash equity instruments; for the JTDshort formula, the notional amount of the instrument shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;
- **P&Llong**=a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the long exposure; gains shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and losses shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;
- **Adjustmentlong**=the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's loss in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; increases shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and decreases shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;
- **JTDshort**=the gross JTD amount for the short exposure;

**6.** Institutions shall assign an LGD of 100 % to equity instruments for the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraph 5.


**7.** In the case of exposures to default risk arising from derivative instruments whose pay-offs in the event of default of the obligor are not related to the notional amount of a specific instrument issued by that obligor or to the LGD of the obligor or an instrument issued by that obligor, institutions shall use alternative methodologies to estimate the gross JTD amounts.


**8.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)how institutions are to determine the components P&Llong, P&Lshort, Adjustmentlong and Adjustmentshort when calculating the JTD amounts for different types of instruments in accordance with this Article;
- (b)which alternative methodologies institutions are to use for the purposes of the estimation of gross JTD amounts referred to in paragraph 7.
- (c)the notional amounts of instruments other than the ones referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2021.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 325x

**Net jump-to-default amounts**

*Article 325X*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate net JTD amounts by offsetting the gross JTD amounts of short exposures and long exposures. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures to the same obligor where the short exposures have the same seniority as, or lower seniority than, the long exposures.


**2.** Offsetting shall be either full or partial, depending on the maturities of the offsetting exposures:
- (a)offsetting shall be full where all offsetting exposures have maturities of one year or more;
- (b)offsetting shall be partial where at least one of the offsetting exposures has a maturity of less than one year, in which case the size of the JTD amount of each exposure with a maturity of less than one year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the exposure's maturity relative to one year.


**3.** Where no offsetting is possible gross JTD amounts shall equal net JTD amounts in the case of exposures with maturities of one year or more. Gross JTD amounts with maturities of less than one year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the exposure's maturity relative to one year, with a floor of three months, to calculate net JTD amounts.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the maturities of the derivative contracts shall be considered, rather than those of their underlyings. Cash equity exposures shall be assigned a maturity of either one year or three months, at the institution's discretion.


**5.** Where the contractual or legal terms of a derivative position having a debt or equity cash instrument as an underlying, and hedged with that debt or equity cash instrument, allow an institution to close out both legs of that position at the time of the expiry of the first-to-mature of the two legs with no exposure to default risk of the underlying, the net jump-to-default amount of the combined position shall be set equal to zero.


# Article 325y

**Calculation of the own funds requirements for the default risk**

*Article 325Y*


**1.** Net JTD amounts, irrespective of the type of counterparty, shall be multiplied by the default risk weights that correspond to their credit quality, as specified in Table 2:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Credit quality category | Default risk weight | 
| Credit quality step 1 | 0,5 % | 
| Credit quality step 2 | 3 % | 
| Credit quality step 3 | 6 % | 
| Credit quality step 4 | 15 % | 
| Credit quality step 5 | 30 % | 
| Credit quality step 6 | 50 % | 
| Unrated | 15 % | 
| Defaulted | 100 % |


**2.** Exposures which would receive a 0 % risk-weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II shall receive a 0 % default risk weight for the own funds requirements for the default risk.


**3.** The weighted net JTD shall be allocated to the following buckets: corporates, sovereigns, and local governments/municipalities.


**4.** Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket, in accordance with the following formula:
- DRCb = max {(Σi ∈ long RWi · net JTDi) – WtS · (Σi ∈ short RWi · |net JTDi|); 0}where:
- **DRCb**=the own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b;
- **i**=the index that denotes an instrument belonging to bucket b;
- **RWi**=the risk weight; and
- **WtS**=a ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated as follows:
$$WtS = 
\frac{
\sum netJTD
_{long}}{
\sum netJTD

For the purposes of calculating the DRCb and the WtS, the long positions and short positions shall be aggregated for all positions within a bucket, regardless of the credit quality step to which those positions are allocated, to produce the bucket-specific own funds requirements for the default risk.


**5.** The final own funds requirement for the default risk for non-securitisations shall be calculated as the simple sum of the bucket-level own funds requirements.


**6.** For the purposes of this Article, an exposure shall be assigned the credit quality category corresponding to the credit quality category that it would be assigned under the standardised approach for credit risk set out in Title II, Chapter 2.


# Article 325z

**Jump-to-default amounts**

*Article 325Z*


**1.** Gross jump-to-default amounts for securitisation exposures shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.


**2.** Net jump-to-default amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross jump-to-default amounts and short gross jump-to-default amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between securitisation exposures with the same underlying asset pool and belonging to the same tranche. No offsetting shall be permitted between securitisation exposures with different underlying asset pools, even where the attachment and detachment points are the same.


**3.** Where, by decomposing or combining existing securitisation exposures, other existing securitisation exposures can be perfectly replicated, except for the maturity dimension, the exposures resulting from that decomposition or combination may be used instead of the existing securitisation exposures for the purposes of offsetting.


**4.** Where, by decomposing or combining existing exposures in underlying names, the entire tranche structure of an existing securitisation exposure can be perfectly replicated, the exposures resulting from that decomposition or combination may be used instead of the existing securitisation exposures for the purposes of offsetting. Where underlying names are used in that manner, they shall be removed from the non-securitisation default risk treatment.


**5.** Article 325x shall apply to both existing securitisation exposures and to securitisation exposures used in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article. The relevant maturities shall be those of the securitisation tranches.


# Article 325aa

**Calculation of the own funds requirement for the default risk for securitisations**

*Article 325AA*


**1.** Net JTD amounts of securitisation exposures shall be multiplied by 8 % of the risk weight that applies to the relevant securitisation exposure, including STS securitisations, in the non-trading book in accordance with the hierarchy of approaches set out in Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II and irrespective of the type of counterparty.


**2.** A maturity of one year shall be applied to all tranches, where risk weights are calculated in accordance with the SEC-IRBA and SEC-ERBA.


**3.** The risk-weighted JTD amounts for individual cash securitisation exposures shall be capped at the fair value of the position.


**4.** Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to the following buckets:
- (a)one common bucket for all corporates, regardless of the region;
- (b)44 different buckets corresponding to one bucket per region for each of the 11 asset classes defined in the second subparagraph.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the 11 asset classes are ABCP, auto loans/leases, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), credit cards, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), collateralised loan obligations, collateralised debt obligations squared (CDO-squared), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), student loans, other retail, other wholesale. The four regions are Asia, Europe, North America, and rest of the world.


**5.** In order to assign a securitisation exposure to a bucket, institutions shall rely on a classification commonly used in the market. Institutions shall assign each securitisation exposure to only one of the buckets referred to in paragraph 4. Any securitisation exposure that an institution cannot assign to a bucket for an asset class or region shall be assigned to the asset class "other retail" or "other wholesale" or to the region "rest of the world", respectively.


**6.** Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in the same manner as for default risk of non-securitisation exposures, using the formula in Article 325y(4), resulting in the own funds requirement for the default risk for each bucket.


**7.** The final own funds requirement for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP shall be calculated as the simple sum of the bucket-level own funds requirements.


# Article 325ab

**Scope**

*Article 325AB*


**1.** For the ACTP, the own funds requirements shall include the default risk for securitisation exposures and for non-securitisation hedges. Those hedges shall be removed from the default risk calculations for non-securitisation. There shall be no diversification benefit between the own funds requirements for the default risk for non-securitisations, the own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP and own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations included in the ACTP.


**2.** For traded non-securitisation credit and equity derivatives, JTD amounts by individual constituents shall be determined by applying a look-through approach.


# Article 325ac

**Jump-to-default amounts for the ACTP**

*Article 325AC*


**1.** For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:
- (a)"decomposition with a valuation model" means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with an LGD of 100 %;
- (b)"replication" means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series;
- (c)"decomposition" means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index.


**2.** The gross JTD amounts for securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures in the ACTP shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.


**3.** Nth-to-default products shall be treated as tranched products with the following attachment and detachment points:
- (a)attachment point = (N – 1) / Total Names;
- (b)detachment point = N / Total Names;where "Total Names" shall be the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool.


**4.** Net JTD amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures that are otherwise identical except for maturity. Offsetting shall only be possible as follows:
- (a)for indices, index tranches and bespoke tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche, subject to the provisions on exposures of less than one year laid down in Article 325x; long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts that perfectly replicate each other may be offset through decomposition into single name equivalent exposures using a valuation model; in such cases, the sum of the gross JTD amounts of the single name equivalent exposures obtained through decomposition shall be equal to the gross JTD amount of the undecomposed exposure;
- (b)offsetting through decomposition as set out is point (a) shall not be allowed for resecuritisations or derivatives on securitisation;
- (c)for indices and index tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche by replication or by decomposition; where the long exposures and short exposures are otherwise equivalent, apart from one residual component, offsetting shall be allowed and the net JTD amount shall reflect the residual exposure;
- (d)different tranches of the same index series, different series of the same index and different index families may not be used to offset each other.


# Article 325ad

**Calculation of the own funds requirements for the default risk for the ACTP**

*Article 325AD*


**1.** Net JTD amounts shall be multiplied by:
- (a)for non-tranched products, the default risk weights corresponding to their credit quality as specified in Article 325y(1) and (2);
- (b)for tranched products, the default risk weights referred to in Article 325aa(1).


**2.** Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to buckets that correspond to an index.


**3.** Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in accordance with the following formula:
- 

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.012101.fmx.tif]*

  where:
- **DRCb**=the own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b;
- **i**=an instrument belonging to bucket b; and
- **WtSACTP**=the ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated in accordance with the WtS formula set out in Article 325y(4), but using long positions and short positions across the entire ACTP and not just the positions in the particular bucket.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for the default risk for the ACTP by using the following formula:

*[Formula: L_2021398EN.01004302.tif]*

  where:
- **DRCACTP**=the own funds requirement for the default risk for the ACTP; and
- **DRCb**=the own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b.

# Article 325be

**Assessment of the modellability of risk factors**

*Article 325BE*


**1.** Institutions shall assess the modellability of all the risk factors of the positions assigned to the trading desks for which they have been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) or are in the process of being granted such permission.For the purposes of the assessment referred to in first subparagraph, competent authorities may allow institutions to use market data provided by third-party vendors.


**1a.** Competent authorities may require an institution to consider not modellable a risk factor that has been assessed as modellable by the institution in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, where the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the risk factor do not meet, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, the requirements referred to in Article 325bc(6).


**2.** As part of the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 325bk for those risk factors that are not modellable.


**2a.** In extraordinary circumstances, occurring during periods of significant reduction in certain trading activities across financial markets, competent authorities may allow institutions using the approach set out in this Chapter to consider as modellable risk factors that have been assessed as not modellable by those institutions in accordance with paragraph 1, provided that the following conditions are met:
- (a)the risk factors subject to the treatment correspond to the trading activities which are significantly reduced across financial markets;
- (b)the treatment is applied temporarily, and for not more than six months within one financial year;
- (c)the treatment does not significantly reduce the total own funds requirements for market risk of the institutions applying it;
- (d)competent authorities immediately notify EBA of any decision to allow institutions to apply the approach set out in this Chapter to consider as modellable risk factors that have been assessed as non-modellable, as well as of the trading activities concerned, and substantiate that decision.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria to assess the modellability of risk factors in accordance with paragraph 1, including where market data provided by third-party vendors are used, and the frequency of that assessment.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 325bf

**Regulatory back-testing requirements and multiplication factors**

*Article 325BF*


**1.** For the purposes of this Article, an "overshooting" means a one-day change in the value of a portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated on the basis of the institution's alternative internal model in accordance with the following requirements:
- (a)the calculation of the value at risk shall be subject to a one-day holding period;
- (b)scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desk's positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;
- (c)data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);
- (d)unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's alternative internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1).


**2.** Institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk.


**3.** An institution's trading desk shall be deemed to meet the back-testing requirements where the number of overshootings for that trading desk that occurred over the most recent 250 business days does not exceed any of the following:
- (a)12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;
- (b)12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio;
- (c)30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;
- (d)30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.


**4.** Institutions shall count daily overshootings in accordance with the following:
- (a)the back-testing of hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and, assuming unchanged positions, the value of the portfolio at the end of the subsequent day;
- (b)the back-testing of actual changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day, excluding fees and commissions;
- (c)an overshooting shall be counted for each business day for which the institution is not able to assess the value of the portfolio or is not able to calculate the value-at-risk number referred to in paragraph 3.


**5.** An institution shall calculate, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article, the multiplication factor (mc) referred to in Article 325ba for the portfolio of all the positions assigned to the trading desks for which it has been granted permission to use alternative internal models as referred to in Article 325az(2).


**6.** The multiplication factor (mc) shall be equal to at least the sum of 1,5 and an add-on determined in accordance with Table 3. For the portfolio referred to in paragraph 5, that add-on shall be calculated on the basis of the number of overshootings that occurred over the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution’s back-testing of the value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph. The calculation of the add-on shall be subject to the following requirements:
- (a)an overshooting shall be a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by the institution's internal model in accordance with the following:(i)a one-day holding period;(ii)a 99th percentile, one tailed confidence interval;(iii)scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desks' positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;(iv)the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);(v)unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1);
- (b)the number of overshootings shall be equal to the greater of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Number of overshootings | Add-on | 
| Fewer than 5 | 0,00 | 
| 5 | 0,20 | 
| 6 | 0,26 | 
| 7 | 0,33 | 
| 8 | 0,38 | 
| 9 | 0,42 | 
| More than 9 | 0,50 | In extraordinary circumstances, competent authorities may permit an institution to do one or both of the following:
- (a)limit the calculation of the add-on to that resulting from overshootings under the back-testing of hypothetical changes where the number of overshootings under the back-testing of actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the institution’s alternative internal model;
- (b)exclude the overshootings evidenced by the back-testing of hypothetical or actual changes from the calculation of the add-on where those overshootings do not result from deficiencies in the institution’s alternative internal model.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, competent authorities may increase the value of mc above the sum referred to in that subparagraph, where an institution’s alternative internal model shows deficiencies preventing the appropriate measurement of the own funds requirements for market risk.


**7.** Competent authorities shall monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 5 and the compliance of trading desks with the back-testing requirements referred to in paragraph 3. Institutions shall promptly notify, the competent authorities of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme and provide an explanation for those overshootings, and in any case shall notify the competent authorities thereof no later than within five business days after the occurrence of an overshooting.


**8.** By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 6, competent authorities may permit an institution not to count an overshooting where a one-day change in the value of its portfolio that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by that institution’s internal model is attributable to a non-modellable risk factor.


**9.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical elements to be included in the actual and hypothetical changes to the value of the portfolio of an institution for the purposes of this Article.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**10.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions and the criteria according to which an institution may be permitted not to count an overshooting where the one-day change in the value of its portfolio that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by that institution’s internal model is attributable to a non-modellable risk factor.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 325bg

**Profit and loss attribution requirement**

*Article 325BG*


**1.** An institution’s trading desk meets the P&L attribution requirements where the theoretical changes in the value of that trading desk’s portfolio, based on the institution’s risk-measurement model, are either close or sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of that trading desk’s portfolio, based on the institution’s pricing model.


**2.** Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, where the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk’s portfolio, based on the institution’s risk-measurement model, are sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of that trading desk’s portfolio, based on the institution’s pricing model, the institution shall calculate, for all positions assigned to that trading desk, an additional own funds requirement to the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(1) and (2).


**3.** On the basis of the results of the P&L attribution requirement referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, an institution shall determine and document a precise list of risk factors included in the institution’s risk-measurement model that are deemed appropriate for verifying the institution’s compliance with the back-testing requirement set out in Article 325bf. The institution shall track any change to the list of those risk factors.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)the criteria specifying whether the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk’s portfolio are either close or sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk’s portfolio for the purposes of paragraph 1, taking into account international regulatory developments;
- (b)the additional own funds requirement referred to in paragraph 2;
- (c)the frequency at which the P&L attribution is to be performed by an institution;
- (d)the technical elements to be included in the theoretical and hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of this Article;
- (e)the manner in which institutions that use the internal model are to aggregate the total own funds requirement for market risk for all their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk, taking into account the consequences referred to in point (b).EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

**Requirements on risk measurement**

*Article 325BH*


**1.** Institutions using an internal risk-measurement model that is used to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk as referred to in Article 325ba shall ensure that that model meets all the following requirements:
- (a)the internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, which shall include at least the risk factors referred to in Subsection 1 of Section 3 of Chapter 1a unless the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the omission of those risk factors does not have a material impact on the results of the P&L attribution requirement referred to in Article 325bg; an institution shall be able to explain to the competent authorities why it has incorporated a risk factor in its pricing model but not in its internal risk-measurement model;
- (b)the internal risk-measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk;
- (c)the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate a set of risk factors that correspond to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance-sheet positions; the institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches; the yield curve shall be divided into various maturity segments to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve; for material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be modelled using a minimum of six maturity segments, and the number of risk factors used to model the yield curve shall be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the institution's trading strategies, the model shall also capture the risk spread of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves or different financial instruments on the same underlying issuer;
- (d)the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution’s positions are denominated; for CIUs, the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account; institutions may rely on third-party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, provided that the correctness of that report is adequately ensured;
- (e)the sophistication of the modelling technique shall be proportionate to the materiality of the institutions' activities in the equity markets; the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions and at least one risk factor that captures systemic movements in equity prices and the dependency of that risk factor on the individual risk factors for each equity market;
- (f)the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions, unless the institution has a small aggregate commodity position compared to all its trading activities, in which case it may use a separate risk factor for each broad commodity type; for material exposures to commodity markets, the model shall capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between commodities that are similar, but not identical, the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches, and the convenience yield between derivative and cash positions;
- (g)the proxies used shall show a good track record for the actual position held, shall be appropriately conservative, and shall be used only where the available data are insufficient, such as during the period of stress referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(2);
- (h)for material exposures to volatility risks in instruments with optionality, the internal risk-measurement model shall capture the dependency of implied volatilities across strike prices and options' maturities;
- (i)for positions in CIUs, institutions shall look through the underlying positions of the CIUs at least on a weekly basis to calculate their own funds requirements in accordance with this Chapter; where the look-through approach is carried out weekly, institutions shall be able to monitor the risks resulting from significant changes in the composition of the CIU; institutions that do not have adequate data inputs or information to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a CIU position in accordance with the look-through approach may rely on a third party to obtain those data inputs or information, provided that all of the following conditions are met:(i)the third party is one of the following:(1)the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;(2)the CIU management company, provided that it meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3), point (a);(3)a third-party vendor on the condition that the data, information or risk metrics are provided or calculated by the third parties referred to in point (1) or (2) of this point or another such third-party vendor;(ii)the third party provides the institution with the data, information or risk metrics to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of the CIU position in accordance with the look-through approach referred to in the first subparagraph;(iii)an external auditor of the institution has confirmed the adequacy of the third party data, information or risk metrics referred to in point (ii) and the competent authority has unrestricted access to those data, information or risk metrics upon request.


**2.** An institution may use empirical correlations within broad categories of risk factors and, for the purpose of calculating the unconstrained expected shortfall measure UESt as referred to in Article 325bb(1) across broad categories of risk factors only where the institution’s approach for measuring those correlations is sound, consistent with either the applicable liquidity horizons or, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, with the base time horizon of 10 days set out in Article 325bc(1), and implemented with integrity.


**3.** By 28 September 2020, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, specifying criteria for the use of data inputs in the risk-measurement model referred to in Article 325bc.

- (f)any internal risk-measurement model, including any pricing model, shall have a proven track record of being reasonably accurate in measuring risks, and shall not differ significantly from the models that the institution uses for its internal risk management;
- (g)the institution shall frequently conduct rigorous programmes of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which shall encompass any internal risk-measurement model; the results of those stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management at least on a monthly basis and shall comply with the policies and limits approved by the management body; the institution shall take appropriate actions where the results of those stress tests show excessive losses arising from the trading's business of the institution under certain circumstances;
- (h)the institution shall conduct an independent review of its internal risk-measurement models, either as part of its regular internal auditing process, or by mandating a third-party undertaking to conduct that review, which shall be conducted to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.A validation unit, which is separate from the risk control unit referred to in the first subparagraph, point (b), shall conduct the initial and ongoing validation of any internal risk-measurement model used in the alternative internal model approach for the purposes of this Chapter.For the purposes of point (h) of the first subparagraph, a third-party undertaking means an undertaking that provides auditing or consulting services to institutions and that has staff who have sufficient skills in the area of market risk in trading activities.


**2.** The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and the independent risk control unit. The institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk management process at least once a year. That review shall assess the following:
- (a)the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process and the organisation of the risk control unit;
- (b)the integration of risk measures into daily risk management and the integrity of the management information system;
- (c)the processes the institution employs for approving the risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;
- (d)the scope of risks captured by the model, the accuracy and appropriateness of the risk-measurement system, and the validation of any significant changes to the internal risk-measurement model;
- (e)the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations, and the accuracy and appropriateness for generating data proxies where the available data are insufficient to meet the requirement set out in this Chapter;
- (f)the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of the data sources used to run any of its internal risk-measurement models, including the independence of those data sources;
- (g)the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate back-testing requirements and P&L attribution requirements that are conducted in order to assess the accuracy of its internal risk-measurement models;
- (h)where the review is performed by a third-party undertaking in accordance with point (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the verification that the internal validation process set out in Article 325bj fulfils its objectives.


**3.** Institutions shall update the techniques and practices they use for any of the internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter to take into account the evolution of new techniques and best practices that develop in respect of those internal risk-measurement models.


# Article 325bj

**Internal validation**

*Article 325BJ*


**1.** Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that any internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties that are independent of the development process, in order to ensure that any such models are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks.


**2.** Institutions shall conduct the validation referred to in paragraph 1 in the following circumstances:
- (a)when any internal risk-measurement model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to that model;
- (b)on a periodic basis, and where there have been significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal risk-measurement model no longer being adequate.


**3.** The validation of the internal risk-measurement models of an institution shall not be limited to back-testing and P&L attribution requirements, but shall, at a minimum, include the following:
- (a)tests to verify whether the assumptions made in the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk;
- (b)own internal model validation tests, including back-testing in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios;
- (c)the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal risk-measurement model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example, material basis risks and concentration risk, or the risks associated with the use of proxies.


# Article 325bk

**Calculation of stress scenario risk measure**

*Article 325BK*


**1.** The "stress scenario risk measure" of a given non-modellable risk factor means the loss that is incurred in all trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange or commodity risk of the portfolio which includes that non-modellable risk factor when an extreme scenario of future shock is applied to that risk factor.


**2.** Institutions shall develop appropriate extreme scenarios of future shock for all non-modellable risk factors, to the satisfaction of their competent authorities.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)how institutions are to develop extreme scenarios of future shock applicable to non-modellable risk factors and how they are to apply those extreme scenarios of future shock to those risk factors;
- (b)a regulatory extreme scenario of future shock for each broad sub-category of risk factors listed in Table 2 of Article 325bd, which institutions may use when they are unable to develop an extreme scenario of future shock in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph, or which competent authorities may require that institution apply if those authorities are not satisfied with the extreme scenario of future shock developed by the institution;
- (c)the circumstances under which institutions may calculate a stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factor;
- (d)how institutions are to aggregate the stress scenario risk measures of all non-modellable risk factors included in their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk.In developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into consideration the requirement that the level of own funds requirements for market risk of a non-modellable risk factor as set out in this Article shall be as high as the level of own funds requirements for market risk that would have been calculated under this Chapter if that risk factor were modellable.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 325bl

**Scope of the internal default risk model**

*Article 325BL*


**1.** All the positions of an institution that have been assigned to the trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) shall be subject to an own funds requirement for default risk where those positions contain at least one risk factor that has been mapped to the broad categories of "equity" or "credit spread" risk factors in accordance with Article 325bd(1). That own funds requirement, which is incremental to the risks captured by the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(1), shall be calculated using the institution's internal default risk model. That model which shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Section.


**2.** For each of the positions referred to in paragraph 1, an institution shall identify one issuer of traded debt or equity instruments related to at least one risk factor.


# Article 325bm

**Permission to use an internal default risk model**

*Article 325BM*


**1.** Competent authorities shall grant an institution permission to use an internal default risk model to calculate the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(2) for all the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl that are assigned to a trading desk for which the internal default risk model complies with the requirements set out in Articles 325bi, 325bj, 325bn, 325bo and 325bp.


**2.** Where the trading desk of an institution, to which at least one of the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl has been assigned, does not meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, the own funds requirements for market risk of all positions in that trading desk shall be calculated in accordance with the approach set out in Chapter 1a.


# Article 325bn

**Own funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model**

*Article 325BN*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model for the portfolio of all trading book positions as referred to in Article 325bl as follows:
- (a)the own funds requirements shall be equal to a value-at-risk number measuring potential losses in the market value of the portfolio caused by the default of issuers related to those positions at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a one-year time horizon;
- (b)the potential loss referred to in point (a) means a direct or indirect loss in the market value of a position which was caused by the default of the issuers and which is incremental to any losses already taken into account in the current valuation of the position; the default of the issuers of equity positions shall be represented by the value for the issuers' equity prices being set to zero;
- (c)institutions shall determine default correlations between different issuers on the basis of a conceptually sound methodology, using objective historical data on market credit spreads or equity prices that cover at least a 10 year period that includes the stress period identified by the institution in accordance with Article 325bc(2); the calculation of default correlations between different issuers shall be calibrated to a one-year time horizon;
- (d)the internal default risk model shall be based on a one-year constant position assumption.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for default risk using an internal default risk model as referred to in paragraph 1 on at least a weekly basis.


**3.** By way of derogation from points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1, an institution may replace the one-year time horizon with a time horizon of sixty days for the purpose of calculating the default risk of some or all of the equity positions, where appropriate. In such case, the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and default probabilities shall be consistent with a time horizon of sixty days and the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and bond prices shall be consistent with a one-year time horizon.


# Article 325bo

**Recognition of hedges in an internal default risk model**

*Article 325BO*


**1.** Institutions may incorporate hedges in their internal default risk model and may net positions where the long positions and short positions relate to the same financial instrument.


**2.** In their internal default risk models, institutions may only recognise hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers by explicitly modelling the gross long and short positions in the different instruments, including modelling of basis risks between different issuers.


**3.** In their internal default risk models, institutions shall capture material basis risks in hedging strategies that arise from differences in the type of product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external ratings, vintage and other differences.Institutions shall ensure that maturity mismatches between a hedging instrument and the hedged instrument that could occur during the one-year time horizon, where those mismatches are not captured in their internal default risk model, do not lead to a material underestimation of risk.Institutions shall recognise a hedging instrument only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit event or other event.


# Article 325bp

**Particular requirements for an internal default risk model**

*Article 325BP*


**1.** The internal default risk model referred to in Article 325bm(1) shall be capable of modelling the default of individual issuers as well as the simultaneous default of multiple issuers, and shall take into account the impact of those defaults in the market values of the positions that are included in the scope of that model. For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using two types of systematic risk factors.


**2.** The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependency between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1.


**3.** The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products.


**4.** The internal default risk model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.


**5.** To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of default probabilities shall meet the following requirements:
- (a)the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,01 % for exposures to which a 0 % risk weight is applied in accordance with Articles 114 to 118 and at 0,01 % for covered bonds to which a 10 % risk weight is applied in accordance with Article 129; otherwise, the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,03 %;
- (b)the default probabilities shall be based on a one-year time horizon, unless stated otherwise in this Section;
- (c)the default probabilities shall be measured using, solely or in combination with current market prices, data observed during a historical period of at least five years of actual past defaults and extreme declines in market prices equivalent to default events; default probabilities shall not be inferred solely from current market prices;
- (d)an institution that has been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Title II, Chapter 3, Section 1 for the exposure class and the rating system corresponding to a given issuer shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate the default probabilities of that issuer, provided that the data to make such an estimate are available;
- (e)an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate default probabilities referred to in point (d) shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate these default probabilities consistently with the requirements applicable to estimates of default probability under this Article.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), the data to estimate the default probabilities of a given issuer of a trading book position are available where, at the calculation date, the institution has a non-trading book position on the same obligor for which it estimates default probabilities in accordance with Title II, Chapter 3, Section 1 to calculate its own funds requirements set out in that Chapter.


**6.** To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of loss given default shall meet the following requirements:
- (a)the loss given default estimates are floored at 0 %;
- (b)the loss given default estimates shall reflect the seniority of each position;
- (c)an institution that has been granted permission to estimate LGD in accordance with Title II, Chapter 3, Section 1, for the exposure class and the rating system corresponding to a given exposure shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate LGD estimates of that issuer, provided that the data to make such an estimate are available;
- (d)an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate LGD referred to in point (c) shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate LGD consistently with the requirements applying to estimates of LGD under this Article.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), the data to estimate the LGD of a given issuer of a trading book position are available where, at the calculation date, the institution has a non-trading book position on the same exposure for which it estimates LGD in accordance with Title II, Chapter 3, Section 1 to calculate its own funds requirements set out in that Chapter.


**7.** As part of the independent review and validation of the internal models that they use for the purposes of this Chapter, including for the risk-measurement system, institutions shall:
- (a)verify that their approach for the modelling of correlations and price changes is appropriate for their portfolio, including the choice and weights of the systematic risk factors in the model;
- (b)perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal default risk model, in particular with regard to the treatment of concentrations; and
- (c)apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.The tests referred to in point (b) shall not be limited to the range of past events experienced.


**8.** The internal default risk model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions.


**9.** The internal default risk model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.


**10.** Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining the default assumptions for correlations between different issuers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bn(1) and the preferred choice of method for estimating the default probabilities in point (e) of paragraph 5 of this Article and the loss given default in point (d) of paragraph 6 of this Article.


**11.** Institutions shall document their internal models so that their correlation assumptions and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.


**12.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the requirements that an institution's internal methodology or external sources are to fulfil for estimating default probabilities and losses given default in accordance with point (e) of paragraph 5 and point (d) of paragraph 6.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 326

**Own funds requirements for position risk**

*Article 326*

The institution's own funds requirement for position risk shall be the sum of the own funds requirements for the general and specific risk of its positions in debt and equity instruments. Securitisation positions in the trading book shall be treated as debt instruments.
# Article 327

**Netting**

*Article 327*


**1.** The absolute value of the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt and convertible issues and identical financial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants shall be its net position in each of those different instruments. In calculating the net position, positions in derivative instruments shall be treated as laid down in Articles 328 to 330. Institutions' holdings of their own debt instruments shall be disregarded in calculating specific risk capital requirements under Article 336.


**2.** No netting shall be allowed between a convertible and an offsetting position in the instrument underlying it, unless the competent authorities adopt an approach under which the likelihood of a particular convertible's being converted is taken into account or require an own funds requirement to cover any loss which conversion might entail. Such approaches or own funds requirements shall be notified to EBA. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines.


**3.** All net positions, irrespective of their signs, shall be converted on a daily basis into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate before their aggregation.


# Article 328

**Interest rate futures and forwards**

*Article 328*


**1.** Interest-rate futures, forward-rate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.


**2.** For the purposes of this Article, "long position" means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and "short position" means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future.


# Article 329

**Options and warrants**

*Article 329*


**1.** Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.


**2.** Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks, apart from the delta risk, associated with options in the own funds requirements.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, referred to in paragraph 2 in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options and warrants.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**4.** Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in paragraph 3, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.


# Article 330

**Swaps**

*Article 330*

Swaps shall be treated for interest-rate risk purposes on the same basis as on-balance-sheet instruments. Thus, an interest-rate swap under which an institution receives floating-rate interest and pays fixed-rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself.
# Article 331

**Interest rate risk on derivative instruments**

*Article 331*


**1.** Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments.


**2.** Institutions which do not use models under paragraph 1 may, treat as fully offsetting any positions in derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 which meet the following conditions at least:
- (a)the positions are of the same value and denominated in the same currency;
- (b)the reference rate (for floating-rate positions) or coupon (for fixed-rate positions) is closely matched;
- (c)the next interest-fixing date or, for fixed coupon positions, residual maturity corresponds with the following limits:(i)less than one month hence: same day;(ii)between one month and one year hence: within seven days;(iii)over one year hence: within 30 days.


# Article 332

**Credit Derivatives**

*Article 332*


**1.** When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the "protection seller"), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows:
- (a)a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation;
- (b)a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds;
- (c)a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;
- (d)in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk;
- (e)a first-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.A -n-th-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less the n-1 reference entities with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.Where an n-th-to-default credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable.


**2.** For the party who transfers credit risk (the protection buyer), the positions are determined as the mirror principle of the protection seller, with the exception of a credit linked note (which entails no short position in the issuer). When calculating the own funds requirement for the "protection buyer", the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. If at a given moment there is a call option in combination with a step-up, such moment is treated as the maturity of the protection.


**3.** Credit derivatives in accordance with Article 325(6) or (8) shall be included only in the determination of the specific risk own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338(2).


# Article 333

**Securities sold under a repurchase agreement or lent**

*Article 333*

The transferor of securities or guaranteed rights relating to title to securities in a repurchase agreement and the lender of securities in a securities lending shall include these securities in the calculation of its own funds requirement under this Chapter provided that such securities are trading book positions.
# Article 334

**Net positions in debt instruments**

*Article 334*

Net positions shall be classified according to the currency in which they are denominated and shall calculate the own funds requirement for general and specific risk in each individual currency separately.
# Article 335

**Cap on the own funds requirement for a net position**

*Article 335*

The institution may cap the own funds requirement for specific risk of a net position in a debt instrument at the maximum possible default-risk related loss. For a short position, that limit may be calculated as a change in value due to the instrument or, where relevant, the underlying names immediately becoming default risk-free.
# Article 336

**Own funds requirement for non-securitisation debt instruments**

*Article 336*


**1.** The institution shall assign its net positions in the trading book in instruments that are not securitisation positions as calculated in accordance with Article 327 to the appropriate categories in Table 1 on the basis of their issuer or obligor, external or internal credit assessment, and residual maturity, and then multiply them by the weightings shown in that table. It shall sum its weighted positions resulting from the application of this Article regardless of whether they are long or short in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Categories | Specific risk own funds requirement | 
| Debt securities which would receive a 0 % risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk. | 0 % | 
| Debt securities which would receive a 20 % or 50 % risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk and other qualifying items as defined in paragraph 4. | 0,25 % (residual term to final maturity six months or less)1,00 % (residual term to final maturity greater than six months and up to and including 24 months)1,60 % (residual term to maturity exceeding 24 months) | 
| Debt securities which would receive a 100 % risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk. | 8,00 % | 
| Debt which would receive a 150 % risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk. | 12,00 % |


**2.** For institutions which apply the IRB Approach to the exposure class of which the issuer of the debt instrument forms part, to qualify for a risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk as referred to in paragraph 1, the issuer of the exposure shall have an internal rating with a PD equivalent to or lower than that associated with the appropriate credit quality step under the Standardised Approach.


**3.** Institutions may calculate the specific risk requirements for any bonds that qualify for a 10 % risk weight in accordance with the treatment set out in Article 129(4), (5) and (6) as half of the applicable specific risk own funds requirement for the second category in Table 1.


**4.** Other qualifying items are:
- (a)long and short positions in assets for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available and which meet all of the following conditions:(i)they are considered by the institution concerned to be sufficiently liquid;(ii)their investment quality is, according to the institution's own discretion, at least equivalent to that of the assets referred to under Table 1 second row;(iii)they are listed on at least one regulated market in a Member State or on a stock exchange in a third country provided that the exchange is recognised by the competent authorities of the relevant Member State;
- (b)long and short positions in assets issued by institutions subject to the own funds requirements set out in this Regulation which are considered by the institution concerned to be sufficiently liquid and whose investment quality is, according to the institution's own discretion, at least equivalent to that of the assets referred to under Table 1 second row;
- (c)securities issued by institutions that are deemed to be of equivalent, or higher, credit quality than those associated with credit quality step 2 under the Standardised Approach for credit risk of exposures to institutions and that are subject to supervisory and regulatory arrangements comparable to those under this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU.Institutions that make use of point (a) or (b) shall have a documented methodology in place to assess whether assets meet the requirements in those points and shall notify this methodology to the competent authorities.


# Article 337

**Own funds requirement for securitisation instruments**

*Article 337*


**1.** For instruments in the trading book that are securitisation positions, the institution shall weight the net positions as calculated in accordance with Article 327(1) with 8 % of the risk weight the institution would apply to the position in its non-trading book according to Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II.


**2.** When determining risk weights for the purposes of paragraph 1, institutions shall use exclusively the approach set out in Title II, Chapter 5, Section 3.


**3.** For securitisation positions that are subject to an additional risk weight in accordance with Article 247(6), 8 % of the total risk weight shall be applied.


**4.** The institution shall sum its weighted positions resulting from the application of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article regardless of whether they are long or short, in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk, except for securitisation positions subject to Article 338(2).


**5.** Where an originator institution of a traditional securitisation does not meet the conditions for significant risk transfer set out in Article 244, the originator institution shall include the exposures underlying the securitisation in its calculation of own funds requirement as if those exposures had not been securitised.Where an originator institution of a synthetic securitisation does not meet the conditions for significant risk transfer set out in Article 245, the originator institution shall include the exposures underlying the securitisation in its calculation of own funds requirements as if those exposures had not been securitised and shall ignore the effect of the synthetic securitisation for credit protection purposes.


# Article 338

**Own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio**

*Article 338*


**1.** For the purposes of this Article, an institution shall determine its correlation trading portfolio in accordance with Article 325(6), (7) and (8).


**2.** An institution shall determine the larger of the following amounts as the specific risk own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio:
- (a)the total specific risk own funds requirement that would apply just to the net long positions of the correlation trading portfolio;
- (b)the total specific risk own funds requirement that would apply just to the net short positions of the correlation trading portfolio.


# Article 339

**Maturity-based calculation of general risk**

*Article 339*


**1.** In order to calculate own funds requirements against general risk all positions shall be weighted according to maturity as explained in paragraph 2 in order to compute the amount of own funds required against them. This requirement shall be reduced when a weighted position is held alongside an opposite weighted position within the same maturity band. A reduction in the requirement shall also be made when the opposite weighted positions fall into different maturity bands, with the size of this reduction depending both on whether the two positions fall into the same zone, or not, and on the particular zones they fall into.


**2.** The institution shall assign its net positions to the appropriate maturity bands in column 2 or 3, as appropriate, in Table 2 in paragraph 4. It shall do so on the basis of residual maturity in the case of fixed-rate instruments and on the basis of the period until the interest rate is next set in the case of instruments on which the interest rate is variable before final maturity. It shall also distinguish between debt instruments with a coupon of 3 % or more and those with a coupon of less than 3 % and thus allocate them to column 2 or column 3 in Table 2. It shall then multiply each of them by the weighing for the maturity band in question in column 4 in Table 2.


**3.** The institution shall then work out the sum of the weighted long positions and the sum of the weighted short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched weighted position in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched weighted position for the same band. The total of the matched weighted positions in all bands shall then be calculated.


**4.** The institution shall compute the totals of the unmatched weighted long positions for the bands included in each of the zones in Table 2 in order to derive the unmatched weighted long position for each zone. Similarly, the sum of the unmatched weighted short positions for each band in a particular zone shall be summed to compute the unmatched weighted short position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long position for a given zone that is matched by the unmatched weighted short position for the same zone shall be the matched weighted position for that zone. That part of the unmatched weighted long or unmatched weighted short position for a zone that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched weighted position for that zone.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zone | Maturity band | Weighting (in %) | Assumed interest rate change (in %) | 
| Coupon of 3 % or more | Coupon of less than 3 % | 
| One | 0 ≤ 1 month | 0 ≤ 1 month | 0,00 | — | 
| > 1 ≤ 3 months | > 1 ≤ 3 months | 0,20 | 1,00 | 
| > 3 ≤ 6 months | > 3 ≤ 6 months | 0,40 | 1,00 | 
| > 6 ≤ 12 months | > 6 ≤ 12 months | 0,70 | 1,00 | 
| Two | > 1 ≤ 2 years | > 1,0 ≤ 1,9 years | 1,25 | 0,90 | 
| > 2 ≤ 3 years | > 1,9 ≤ 2,8 years | 1,75 | 0,80 | 
| > 3 ≤ 4 years | > 2,8 ≤ 3,6 years | 2,25 | 0,75 | 
| Three | > 4 ≤ 5 years | > 3,6 ≤ 4,3 years | 2,75 | 0,75 | 
| > 5 ≤ 7 years | > 4,3 ≤ 5,7 years | 3,25 | 0,70 | 
| > 7 ≤ 10 years | > 5,7 ≤ 7,3 years | 3,75 | 0,65 | 
| > 10 ≤ 15 years | > 7,3 ≤ 9,3 years | 4,50 | 0,60 | 
| > 15 ≤ 20 years | > 9,3 ≤ 10,6 years | 5,25 | 0,60 | 
| > 20 years | > 10,6 ≤ 12,0 years | 6,00 | 0,60 | 
|  | > 12,0 ≤ 20,0 years | 8,00 | 0,60 | 
|  | > 20 years | 12,50 | 0,60 |


**5.** The amount of the unmatched weighted long or short position in zone one which is matched by the unmatched weighted short or long position in zone two shall then be the matched weighted position between zones one and two. The same calculation shall then be undertaken with regard to that part of the unmatched weighted position in zone two which is left over and the unmatched weighted position in zone three in order to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three.


**6.** The institution may reverse the order in paragraph 5 so as to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three before calculating that position between zones one and two.


**7.** The remainder of the unmatched weighted position in zone one shall then be matched with what remains of that for zone three after the latter's matching with zone two in order to derive the matched weighted position between zones one and three.


**8.** Residual positions, following the three separate matching calculations in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 shall be summed.


**9.** The institution's own funds requirement shall be calculated as the sum of:
- (a)10 % of the sum of the matched weighted positions in all maturity bands;
- (b)40 % of the matched weighted position in zone one;
- (c)30 % of the matched weighted position in zone two;
- (d)30 % of the matched weighted position in zone three;
- (e)40 % of the matched weighted position between zones one and two and between zones two and three;
- (f)150 % of the matched weighted position between zones one and three;
- (g)100 % of the residual unmatched weighted positions.


# Article 340

**Duration-based calculation of general risk**

*Article 340*


**1.** Institutions may use an approach for calculating the own funds requirement for the general risk on debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the approach set out in Article 339, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis.


**2.** Under the duration-based approach referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall take the market value of each fixed-rate debt instrument and hence calculate its yield to maturity, which is implied discount rate for that instrument. In the case of floating-rate instruments, the institution shall take the market value of each instrument and hence calculate its yield on the assumption that the principal is due when the interest rate can next be changed.


**3.** The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula:
$$modified duration = 
\frac{D}{1  + R}$$
where:
- **D**=duration calculated according to the following formula:
$$D = 
\frac{
\sum
_{t = 1}
\frac{t  \times  C
_{t}}{
\left(1  +  R\right)
^{t}}}{
\sum
_{t = 1}
\frac{C
_{t}}{
\left(1 +  R\right)
^{t}}}$$
where:
- **R**=yield to maturity;
- **Ct**=cash payment in time t;
- **M**=total maturity.Correction shall be made to the calculation of the modified duration for debt instruments which are subject to prepayment risk. EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines about how to apply such corrections.


**4.** The institution shall then allocate each debt instrument to the appropriate zone in Table 3. It shall do so on the basis of the modified duration of each instrument.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zone | Modified duration(in years) | Assumed interest (change in %) | 
| One | > 0 ≤ 1,0 | 1,0 | 
| Two | > 1,0 ≤ 3,6 | 0,85 | 
| Three | > 3,6 | 0,7 |


**5.** The institution shall then calculate the duration-weighted position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed interest-rate change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3).


**6.** The institution shall calculate its duration-weighted long and its duration-weighted short positions within each zone. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter within each zone shall be the matched duration-weighted position for that zone.The institution shall then calculate the unmatched duration-weighted positions for each zone. It shall then follow the procedures laid down for unmatched weighted positions in Article 339(5) to (8).


**7.** The institution's own funds requirement shall then be calculated as the sum of the following:
- (a)2 % of the matched duration-weighted position for each zone;
- (b)40 % of the matched duration-weighted positions between zones one and two and between zones two and three;
- (c)150 % of the matched duration-weighted position between zones one and three;
- (d)100 % of the residual unmatched duration-weighted positions.


# Article 341

**Net positions in equity instruments**

*Article 341*


**1.** The institution shall separately sum all its net long positions and all its net short positions in accordance with Article 327. The sum of the absolute values of the two figures shall be its overall gross position.


**2.** The institution shall calculate, separately for each market, the difference between the sum of the net long and the net short positions. The sum of the absolute values of those differences shall be its overall net position.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining the term market referred to in paragraph 2.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 January 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 342

**Specific risk of equity instruments**

*Article 342*

The institution shall multiply its overall gross position by 8 % in order to calculate its own funds requirement against specific risk.
# Article 343

**General risk of equity instruments**

*Article 343*

The own funds requirement against general risk shall be the institution's overall net position multiplied by 8 %.
# Article 344

**Stock indices**

*Article 344*


**1.** EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the stock indices for which the treatments set out in the second sentence of paragraph 4 is available.EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**2.** Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in paragraph 1, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in the second sentence of paragraph 4, where the competent authorities have applied that treatment before 1 January 2014.


**3.** Stock-index futures, the delta-weighted equivalents of options in stock-index futures and stock indices collectively referred to hereafter as "stock-index futures", may be broken down into positions in each of their constituent equities. These positions may be treated as underlying positions in the equities in question, and may, be netted against opposite positions in the underlying equities themselves. Institutions shall notify the competent authority of the use they make of that treatment.


**4.** Where a stock-index future is not broken down into its underlying positions, it shall be treated as if it were an individual equity. However, the specific risk on this individual equity can be ignored if the stock-index future in question is exchange traded and represents a relevant appropriately diversified index.


# Article 345

**Reduction of net positions**

*Article 345*


**1.** In the case of the underwriting of debt and equity instruments, an institution may use the following procedure in calculating its own funds requirements. The institution shall first calculate the net positions by deducting the underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of formal agreements. The institution shall then reduce the net positions by the reduction factors in Table 4 and calculate its own funds requirements using the reduced underwriting positions.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| working day 0: | 100 % | 
| working day 1: | 90 % | 
| working days 2 to 3: | 75 % |

| working day 5: | 25 % | 
| after working day 5: | 0 %. | "Working day zero" shall be the working day on which the institution becomes unconditionally committed to accepting a known quantity of securities at an agreed price.


**2.** The institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of paragraph 1.


# Article 346

**Allowance for hedges by credit derivatives**

*Article 346*


**1.** An allowance shall be given for hedges provided by credit derivatives, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 to 6.


**2.** Institutions shall treat the position in the credit derivative as one "leg" and the hedged position that has the same nominal, or, where applicable, notional amount, as the other "leg".


**3.** Full allowance shall be given when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same extent. This will be the case in the following situations:
- (a)the two legs consist of completely identical instruments;
- (b)a long cash position is hedged by a total rate of return swap (or vice versa) and there is an exact match between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure (i.e., the cash position). The maturity of the swap itself may be different from that of the underlying exposure.In these situations, a specific risk own funds requirement shall not be applied to either side of the position.


**4.** An 80 % offset will be applied when the values of the two legs always move in the opposite direction and where there is an exact match in terms of the reference obligation, the maturity of both the reference obligation and the credit derivative, and the currency of the underlying exposure. In addition, key features of the credit derivative contract shall not cause the price movement of the credit derivative to materially deviate from the price movements of the cash position. To the extent that the transaction transfers risk, an 80 % specific risk offset will be applied to the side of the transaction with the higher own funds requirement, while the specific risk requirements on the other side shall be zero.


**5.** Partial allowance shall be given, absent the situations in paragraphs 3 and 4, in the following situations:
- (a)the position falls under paragraph 3(b) but there is an asset mismatch between the reference obligation and the underlying exposure. However, the positions meet the following requirements:(i)the reference obligation ranks pari passu with or is junior to the underlying obligation;(ii)the underlying obligation and reference obligation share the same obligor and have legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses;
- (b)the position falls under paragraph 3(a) or paragraph 4 but there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying asset. Such currency mismatch shall be included in the own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk;
- (c)the position falls under paragraph 4 but there is an asset mismatch between the cash position and the credit derivative. However, the underlying asset is included in the (deliverable) obligations in the credit derivative documentation.In order to give partial allowance, rather than adding the specific risk own funds requirements for each side of the transaction, only the higher of the two own funds requirements shall apply.


**6.** In all situations not falling under paragraphs 3 to 5, an own funds requirement for specific risk shall be calculated for both sides of the positions separately.


# Article 347

**Allowance for hedges by first and nth-to default credit derivatives**

*Article 347*

In the case of first-to-default credit derivatives and nth-to-default credit derivatives, the following treatment applies for the allowance to be given in accordance with Article 346:
- (a)where an institution obtains credit protection for a number of reference entities underlying a credit derivative under the terms that the first default among the assets shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, the institution may offset specific risk for the reference entity to which the lowest specific risk percentage charge among the underlying reference entities applies in accordance with Table 1 in Article 336;
- (b)where the nth default among the exposures triggers payment under the credit protection, the protection buyer may only offset specific risk if protection has also been obtained for defaults 1 to n-1 or when n-1 defaults have already occurred. In such cases, the methodology set out in point (a) for first-to-default credit derivatives shall be followed appropriately amended for nth-to-default products.
# Article 348

**Own funds requirements for CIUs**

*Article 348*


**1.** Without prejudice to other provisions in this Section, positions in CIUs shall be subject to an own funds requirement for position risk, comprising general and specific risk, of 32 %. Without prejudice to Article 353 taken together with the amended gold treatment set out in Article 352(4) positions in CIUs shall be subject to an own funds requirement for position risk, comprising general and specific risk, and foreign exchange risk of 40 %.


**2.** Unless noted otherwise in Article 350, no netting is permitted between the underlying investments of a CIU and other positions held by the institution.


# Article 349

**General criteria for CIUs**

*Article 349*

CIUs shall be eligible for the approach set out in Article 350, where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the CIU's prospectus or equivalent document shall include all of the following:
- (i)the categories of assets in which the CIU is authorised to invest;
- (ii)where investment limits apply, the relative limits and the methodologies to calculate them;
- (iii)where leverage is allowed, the maximum level of leverage;
- (iv)where concluding OTC financial derivatives transactions or repurchase transactions or securities borrowing or lending is allowed, a policy to limit counterparty risk arising from these transactions;

- (e)there shall be adequate risk assessment of the CIU, by the investing institution;
- (f)CIUs shall be managed by persons supervised in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC or equivalent legislation.
# Article 350

**Specific methods for CIUs**

*Article 350*


**1.** Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk. Under such an approach, positions in CIUs shall be treated as positions in the underlying investments of the CIU. Netting shall be permitted between positions in the underlying investments of the CIU and other positions held by the institution, provided that the institution holds a sufficient quantity of shares or units to allow for redemption/creation in exchange for the underlying investments.


**2.** Institutions may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, for positions in CIUs by assuming positions representing those necessary to replicate the composition and performance of the externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities referred to in point (a), subject to the following conditions:
- (a)the purpose of the CIU's mandate is to replicate the composition and performance of an externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities;
- (b)a minimum correlation coefficient between daily returns on the CIU and the index or basket of equities or debt securities it tracks of 0,9 can be clearly established over a minimum period of six months.


**3.** Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions:
- (a)it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position;
- (b)institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate;
- (c)if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level.


**4.** Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter:
- (a)the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository;
- (b)for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.


# Article 351

**De minimis and weighting for foreign exchange risk**

*Article 351*

If the sum of an institution’s overall net foreign exchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 352, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, the institution shall calculate an own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net foreign exchange position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %.
# Article 352

**Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange position**

*Article 352*


**1.** The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative):
- (a)the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold);
- (b)the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position;
- (c)irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable;
- (d)the net delta, or delta-based, equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options;
- (e)the market value of other options.The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently.The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies in accordance with the quotas in force.


**2.** Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.


**3.** An institution may use the net present value when calculating the net open position in each currency and in gold provided that the institution applies this approach consistently.


**4.** Net short and long positions in each currency other than the reporting currency and the net long or short position in gold shall be converted at spot rates into the reporting currency. They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively. The higher of these two totals shall be the institution's overall net foreign-exchange position.


**5.** Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements.


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.


# Article 353

**Foreign exchange risk of CIUs**

*Article 353*


**1.** For the purposes of Article 352, in respect of CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account.


**2.** Institutions may rely on the following third parties' reporting of the foreign exchange positions in the CIU:
- (a)the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;
- (b)for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of Article 132(3).The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.


**3.** Where an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions in a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU is invested up to the maximum extent allowed under the CIU's mandate in foreign exchange and institutions shall, for trading book positions, take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. This shall be done by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the investment mandate. The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the addition of the total long position to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position to the total short open foreign exchange position where the direction of the CIU's investment is available. There shall be no netting allowed between such positions prior to the calculation.


# Article 354

**Closely correlated currencies**

*Article 354*


**1.** Institutions may provide lower own funds requirements against positions in relevant closely correlated currencies. A pair of currencies is deemed to be closely correlated only if the likelihood of a loss — calculated on the basis of daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years — occurring on equal and opposite positions in such currencies over the following 10 working days, which is 4 % or less of the value of the matched position in question (valued in terms of the reporting currency) has a probability of at least 99 %, when an observation period of three years is used, and 95 %, when an observation period of five years is used. The own-funds requirement on the matched position in two closely correlated currencies shall be 4 % multiplied by the value of the matched position.


**2.** In calculating the requirements of this Chapter, institutions may disregard positions in currencies, which are subject to a legally binding intergovernmental agreement to limit its variation relative to other currencies covered by the same agreement. Institutions shall calculate their matched positions in such currencies and subject them to an own funds requirement no lower than half of the maximum permissible variation laid down in the intergovernmental agreement in question in respect of the currencies concerned.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies for which the treatment set out in paragraph 1 is available.EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**4.** The own funds requirement on the matched positions in currencies of Member States participating in the second stage of the economic and monetary union may be calculated as 1,6 % of the value of such matched positions.


**5.** Only the unmatched positions in currencies referred to in this Article shall be incorporated into the overall net open position in accordance with Article 352(4).


**6.** Where daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years — occurring on equal and opposite positions in a pair of currencies over the following 10 working days show that these two currencies are perfectly positively correlated and the institution always can face a zero bid/ask spread on the respective trades, the institution can, upon explicit permission by its competent authority, apply an own funds requirement of 0 % until the end of 2017.


# Article 355

**Choice of method for commodities risk**

*Article 355*

# Article 356

**Ancillary commodities business**

*Article 356*


**1.** Institutions with ancillary agricultural commodities business may determine the own funds requirements for their physical commodity stock at the end of each year for the following year where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)at any time of the year it holds own funds for this risk which are not lower than the average own funds requirement for that risk estimated on a conservative basis for the coming year;
- (b)it estimates on a conservative basis the expected volatility for the figure calculated under point (a);
- (c)its average own funds requirement for this risk does not exceed 5 % of its own funds or EUR 1 million and, taking into account the volatility estimated in accordance with (b), the expected peak own funds requirements do not exceed 6,5 % of its own funds;
- (d)the institution monitors on an ongoing basis whether the estimates carried out under points (a) and (b) still reflect the reality.


**2.** Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of the option provided in paragraph 1.


# Article 357

**Positions in commodities**

*Article 357*


**1.** Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement. The spot price in each commodity shall be expressed in the reporting currency.


**2.** Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreign-exchange risk and treated in accordance with Chapter 3 or 5, as appropriate, for the purpose of calculating commodities risk.


**3.** For the purpose of Article 360(1), the excess of an institution's long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. Derivative instruments shall be treated, as laid down in Article 358, as positions in the underlying commodity.


**4.** For the purposes of calculating a position in a commodity, the following positions shall be treated as positions in the same commodity:
- (a)positions in different sub-categories of commodities in cases where the sub-categories are deliverable against each other;
- (b)positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and where a minimum correlation of 0,9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year.


# Article 358

**Particular instruments**

*Article 358*


**1.** Commodity futures and forward commitments to buy or sell individual commodities shall be incorporated in the measurement system as notional amounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement and assigned a maturity with reference to expiry date.


**2.** Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be treated, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with, where relevant, one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity bands in Article 359(1). The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.


**3.** Options and warrants on commodities or on commodity derivatives shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying commodity or commodity derivative. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.


**5.** Where an institution is either of the following, it shall include the commodities concerned in the calculation of its own funds requirement for commodities risk:
- (a)the transferor of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities in a repurchase agreement;
- (b)the lender of commodities in a commodities lending agreement.


# Article 359

**Maturity ladder approach**

*Article 359*


**1.** The institution shall use a separate maturity ladder in line with Table 1 for each commodity. All positions in that commodity shall be assigned to the appropriate maturity bands. Physical stocks shall be assigned to the first maturity band between 0 and up to and including 1 month.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Maturity band(1) | Spread rate (in %)(2) | 
| 0 ≤ 1 month | 1,50 | 
| > 1 ≤ 3 months | 1,50 | 
| > 3 ≤ 6 months | 1,50 | 
| > 6 ≤ 12 months | 1,50 | 
| > 1 ≤ 2 years | 1,50 | 
| > 2 ≤ 3 years | 1,50 | 
| > 3 years | 1,50 |


**2.** Positions in the same commodity may be offset and assigned to the appropriate maturity bands on a net basis for the following:
- (a)positions in contracts maturing on the same date;
- (b)positions in contracts maturing within 10 days of each other if the contracts are traded on markets which have daily delivery dates.


**3.** The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched positions in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched position for the same band.


**4.** That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position.


**5.** The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following:
- (a)the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity;
- (b)the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity;
- (c)the residual unmatched positions, multiplied by 15 % which is the outright rate and by the spot price for the commodity.


**6.** The institution's overall own funds requirement for commodities risk shall be calculated as the sum of the own funds requirements calculated for each commodity in accordance with paragraph 5.


# Article 360

**Simplified approach**

*Article 360*


**1.** The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated as the sum of the following:
- (a)15 % of the net position, long or short, multiplied by the spot price for the commodity;
- (b)3 % of the gross position, long plus short, multiplied by the spot price for the commodity.


**2.** The institution's overall own funds requirement for commodities risk shall be calculated as the sum of the own funds requirements calculated for each commodity in accordance with paragraph 1.


# Article 361

**Extended maturity ladder approach**

*Article 361*

Institutions may use the minimum spread, carry and outright rates set out in the following Table 2 instead of those indicated in Article 359 provided that the institutions:
- (a)undertake significant commodities business;
- (b)have an appropriately diversified commodities portfolio.
- (c)are not yet in a position to use internal models for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirement for commodities risk.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Precious metals (except gold) | Base metals | Agricultural products (softs) | Other, including energy products | 
| Spread rate (%) | 1,0 | 1,2 | 1,5 | 1,5 | 
| Carry rate (%) | 0,3 | 0,5 | 0,6 | 0,6 | 
| Outright rate (%) | 8 | 10 | 12 | 15 | Institutions shall notify the use they make of this Article to their competent authorities.
# Article 362

**Specific and general risks**

*Article 362*

Position risk on a traded debt instrument or equity instrument or derivative thereof may be divided into two components for purposes of this Chapter. The first shall be its specific risk component and shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The general risk component shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument due in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative to a change in the level of interest rates or in the case of an equity or equity derivative to a broad equity-market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities.
# Article 363

**Permission to use internal models**

*Article 363*


**1.** After having verified an institution's compliance with the requirements of Sections 2, 3 and 4 as relevant, competent authorities shall grant permission to institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for one or more of the following risk categories by using their internal models instead of or in combination with the methods in Chapters 2 to 4:
- (a)general risk of equity instruments;
- (b)specific risk of equity instruments;
- (c)general risk of debt instruments;
- (d)specific risk of debt instruments;
- (e)foreign-exchange risk;
- (f)commodities risk.


**2.** For risk categories for which the institution has not been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 1 to use its internal models, that institution shall continue to calculate own funds requirements in accordance with those Chapters 2, 3 and 4 as relevant. Permission by the competent authorities for the use of internal models shall be required for each risk category and shall be granted only if the internal model covers a significant share of the positions of a certain risk category.


**3.** Material changes to the use of internal models that the institution has received permission to use, the extension of the use of internal models that the institution has received permission to use, in particular to additional risk categories, and the initial calculation of stressed value-at-risk in accordance with Article 365(2) require a separate permission by the competent authority.Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of all other extensions and changes to the use of those internal models that the institution has received permission to use.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)the conditions for assessing materiality of extensions and changes to the use of internal models;
- (b)the assessment methodology under which competent authorities permit institutions to use internal models;
- (c)the conditions under which the share of positions covered by the internal model within a risk category shall be considered significant as referred to in paragraph 2.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 364

**Own funds requirements when using internal models**

*Article 364*


**1.** Each institution using an internal model shall fulfil, in addition to own funds requirements calculated in accordance with Chapters 2, 3 and 4 for those risk categories for which permission to use an internal model has not been granted, an own funds requirement expressed as the sum of points (a) and (b):
- (a)the higher of the following values:(i)its previous day's value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with Article 365(1) (VaRt-1);(ii)an average of the daily value-at-risk numbers calculated in accordance with Article 365(1) on each of the preceding sixty business days (VaRavg), multiplied by the multiplication factor (mc) in accordance with Article 366;
- (b)the higher of the following values:(i)its latest available stressed-value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with Article 365(2) (sVaRt-1); and(ii)an average of the stressed value-at-risk numbers calculated in the manner and frequency specified in Article 365(2) during the preceding sixty business days (sVaRavg), multiplied by the multiplication factor (ms) in accordance with Article 366;


**2.** Institutions that use an internal model to calculate their own funds requirement for specific risk of debt instruments shall fulfil an additional own funds requirement expressed as the sum of the following points (a) and (b):
- (a)the own funds requirement calculated in accordance with Article 337 and 338 for the specific risk of securitisation positions and nth to default credit derivatives in the trading book with the exception of those incorporated in an own funds requirement for the specific risk of the correlation trading portfolio in accordance with Section 5 and, where applicable, the own funds requirement for specific risk in accordance with Chapter 2, Section 6, for those positions in CIUs for which neither the conditions in Article 350(1) nor Article 350(2) are fulfilled;
- (b)the higher of:(i)the most recent risk number for the incremental default and migration risk calculated in accordance with Section 3;(ii)the average of this number over the preceding 12 weeks.


**3.** Institutions that have a correlation trading portfolio, which meets the requirements in Article 338(1) to (3), may fulfil an own funds requirement on the basis of Article 377 instead of Article 338(4), calculated as the higher of the following:
- (a)the most recent risk number for the correlation trading portfolio calculated in accordance with Section 5;
- (b)the average of this number over the preceding 12-weeks;
- (c)8 % of the own funds requirement that would, at the time of calculation of the most recent risk number referred to in point (a), be calculated in accordance with Article 338(4) for all those positions incorporated into the internal model for the correlation trading portfolio.


# Article 365

**VaR and stressed VaR Calculation**

*Article 365*


**1.** The calculation of the value-at-risk number referred to in Article 364 shall be subject to the following requirements:
- (a)daily calculation of the value-at-risk number;
- (b)a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval;
- (c)a 10-day holding period;
- (d)an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility;
- (e)at least monthly data set updates.The institution may use value-at-risk numbers calculated according to shorter holding periods than 10 days scaled up to 10 days by an appropriate methodology that is reviewed periodically.


**2.** In addition, the institution shall at least weekly calculate a "stressed value-at-risk" of the current portfolio, in accordance with the requirements set out in the first paragraph, with value-at-risk model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to the institution's portfolio. The choice of such historical data shall be subject to at least annual review by the institution, which shall notify the outcome to the competent authorities. EBA shall monitor the range of practices for calculating stressed value at risk and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines on such practices.


# Article 366

**Regulatory back testing and multiplication factors**

*Article 366*


**1.** The results of the calculations referred to in Article 365 shall be scaled up by the multiplication factors (mc) and (ms).


**2.** Each of the multiplication factors (mc) and (ms) shall be the sum of at least 3 and an addend between 0 and 1 in accordance with Table 1. That addend shall depend on the number of overshootings for the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution's back-testing of the value-at-risk number as set out in Article 365(1).

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Number of overshootings | addend | 
| Fewer than 5 | 0,00 | 
| 5 | 0,40 | 
| 6 | 0,50 | 
| 7 | 0,65 | 
| 8 | 0,75 | 
| 9 | 0,85 | 
| 10 or more | 1,00 |


**3.** The institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing on hypothetical and actual changes in the portfolio's value. An overshooting is a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related one-day value-at-risk number generated by the institution's model. For the purpose of determining the addend the number of overshootings shall be assessed at least quarterly and shall be equal to the higher of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio.Back-testing on hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and, assuming unchanged positions, its value at the end of the subsequent day.Back-testing on actual changes in the portfolio's value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day excluding fees, commissions, and net interest income.


**4.** The competent authorities may in individual cases limit the addend to that resulting from overshootings under hypothetical changes, where the number of overshootings under actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model.


**5.** In order to allow competent authorities to monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factors on an ongoing basis, institutions shall notify promptly, and in any case no later than within five working days, the competent authorities of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme.


# Article 367

**Requirements on risk measurement**

*Article 367*


**1.** Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk, commodities risk and any internal model for correlation trading shall meet all of the following requirements:
- (a)the model shall capture accurately all material price risks;
- (b)the model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, depending on the level of activity of the institution in the respective markets. Where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution's pricing model but not into the risk-measurement model, the institution shall be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent authority. The risk- measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Where proxies for risk factors are used they shall show a good track record for the actual position held.


**2.** Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements:
- (a)the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;
- (b)the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3);
- (c)the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;
- (d)the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions;
- (e)the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.


**3.** Institutions may, in any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories only if the institution's approach for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity.


# Article 368

**Qualitative requirements**

*Article 368*


**1.** Any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and, in particular, all of the following qualitative requirements shall be met:
- (a)any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk-management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;
- (b)the institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and reports directly to senior management. The unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, being responsible for the overall risk management system. The unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used for calculating capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk and commodities risk, and on the appropriate measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;
- (c)the institution's management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institution's overall risk exposure;
- (d)the institution shall have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter, in the trading, risk-control, audit and back-office areas;
- (e)the institution shall have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter;
- (f)any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks;
- (g)the institution shall frequently conduct a rigorous programme of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which encompasses any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter and the results of these stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it sets. This process shall particularly address illiquidity of markets in stressed market conditions, concentration risk, one way markets, event and jump-to-default risks, non-linearity of products, deep out-of-the-money positions, positions subject to the gapping of prices and other risks that may not be captured appropriately in the internal models. The shocks applied shall reflect the nature of the portfolios and the time it could take to hedge out or manage risks under severe market conditions;
- (h)the institution shall conduct, as part of its regular internal auditing process, an independent review of its internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter.


**2.** The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk-control unit. At least once a year, the institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk-management process. The review shall consider the following:
- (a)the adequacy of the documentation of the risk-management system and process and the organisation of the risk-control unit;
- (b)the integration of risk measures into daily risk management and the integrity of the management information system;
- (c)the process the institution employs for approving risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;
- (d)the scope of risks captured by the risk-measurement model and the validation of any significant changes in the risk-measurement process;
- (e)the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, and the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations;
- (f)the verification process the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources used to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;
- (g)the verification process the institution uses to evaluate back-testing that is conducted to assess the models' accuracy.


**3.** As techniques and best practices evolve, institutions shall apply those new techniques and practices in any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter.


# Article 369

**Internal Validation**

*Article 369*


**1.** Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that all their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process to ensure that they are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. The validation shall be conducted when the internal model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the internal model. The validation shall also be conducted on a periodic basis but especially where there have been any significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal model no longer being adequate. As techniques and best practices for internal validation evolve, institutions shall apply these advances. Internal model validation shall not be limited to back-testing, but shall, at a minimum, also include the following:
- (a)tests to demonstrate that any assumptions made within the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk;
- (b)in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, institutions shall carry out their own internal model validation tests, including back-testing, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios;
- (c)the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example material basis risks and concentration risk.


**2.** The institution shall perform back-testing on both actual and hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value.


# Article 370

**Requirements for modelling specific risk**

*Article 370*

An internal model used for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk and an internal model for correlation trading shall meet the following additional requirements:
- (a)it explains the historical price variation in the portfolio;
- (b)it captures concentration in terms of magnitude and changes of composition of the portfolio;
- (c)it is robust to an adverse environment;
- (d)it is validated through back-testing aimed at assessing whether specific risk is being accurately captured. If the institution performs such back-testing on the basis of relevant sub-portfolios, these shall be chosen in a consistent manner;
- (e)it captures name-related basis risk and shall in particular be sensitive to material idiosyncratic differences between similar but not identical positions;
- (f)it captures event risk.
# Article 371

**Exclusions from specific risk models**

*Article 371*


**1.** An institution may choose to exclude from the calculation of its specific risk own funds requirement using an internal model those positions for which it fulfils an own funds requirement for specific risk in accordance with Article 332(1)(e) or Article 337 with exception of those positions that are subject to the approach set out in Article 377.


**2.** An institution may choose not to capture default and migration risks for traded debt instruments in its internal model where it is capturing those risks through the requirements set out in Section 4.


# Article 372

**Requirement to have an internal IRC model**

*Article 372*

An institution that uses an internal model for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk of traded debt instruments shall also have an internal incremental default and migration risk (IRC) model in place to capture the default and migration risks of its trading book positions that are incremental to the risks captured by the value-at-risk measure as specified in Article 365(1). The institution shall demonstrate that its internal model meets the following standards under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality:
- (a)the internal model provides a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent estimates of incremental default and migration risk;
- (b)the internal model's estimates for potential losses play an essential role in the risk management of the institution;
- (c)the market and position data used for the internal model are up-to-date and subject to an appropriate quality assessment;
- (d)the requirements in Article 367(3), Article 368, Article 369(1) and points (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 370 are met.EBA shall issue guidelines on the requirements in Articles 373 to 376.
# Article 373

**Scope of the internal IRC model**

*Article 373*

The internal IRC model shall cover all positions subject to an own funds requirement for specific interest rate risk, including those subject to a 0 % specific risk capital charge under Article 336, but shall not cover securitisation positions and n-th-to-default credit derivatives.The institution may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, choose to consistently include all listed equity positions and derivatives positions based on listed equities. The permission shall be granted if such inclusion is consistent with how the institution internally measures and manages risk.
# Article 374

**Parameters of the internal IRC model**

*Article 374*


**1.** Institutions shall use the internal model to calculate a number which measures losses due to default and internal or external ratings migration at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.


**2.** Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected.


**3.** The internal IRC model shall reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors shall not be reflected.


**4.** The internal model shall be based on the assumption of a constant level of risk over the one-year time horizon, implying that given individual trading book positions or sets of positions that have experienced default or migration over their liquidity horizon are re-balanced at the end of their liquidity horizon to attain the initial level of risk. Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a one-year constant position assumption.


**5.** The liquidity horizons shall be set according to the time required to sell the position or to hedge all material relevant price risks in a stressed market, having particular regard to the size of the position. Liquidity horizons shall reflect actual practice and experience during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses. The liquidity horizon shall be measured under conservative assumptions and shall be sufficiently long that the act of selling or hedging, in itself, would not materially affect the price at which the selling or hedging would be executed.


**6.** The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions is subject to a floor of three months.


**7.** The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions shall take into account an institution's internal policies relating to valuation adjustments and the management of stale positions. When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions. The liquidity horizon for a securitisation warehouse shall reflect the time to build, sell and securitise the assets, or to hedge the material risk factors, under stressed market conditions.


# Article 375

**Recognition of hedges in the internal IRC model**

*Article 375*


**1.** Hedges may be incorporated into an institution's internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks. Positions may be netted when long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments. Institutions shall reflect the impact of material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge's maturity and the liquidity horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instruments. An institution shall reflect a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event.


**2.** For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution:
- (a)chooses to model rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading book positions;
- (b)demonstrates that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a better risk measurement;
- (c)demonstrates that the markets for the instruments serving as hedges are liquid enough to allow for such rebalancing even during periods of stress. Any residual risks resulting from dynamic hedging strategies shall be reflected in the own funds requirement.


# Article 376

**Particular requirements for the internal IRC model**

*Article 376*


**1.** The internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options, structured credit derivatives and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. The institution shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with such products.


**2.** The internal model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.


**3.** As part of the independent review and validation of their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter, inclusively for purposes of the risk measurement system, an institution shall in particular do all of the following:
- (a)validate that its modelling approach for correlations and price changes is appropriate for its portfolio, including the choice and weights of its systematic risk factors;
- (b)perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal model, particularly with regard to the treatment of concentrations. Such tests shall not be limited to the range of events experienced historically;
- (c)apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.


**4.** The internal model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.


**5.** Institutions shall document their internal models so that its correlation and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.


**6.** The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.


# Article 377

**Requirements for an internal model for correlation trading**

*Article 377*


**1.** Competent authorities shall grant permission to use an internal model for the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio instead of the own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338 to institutions that are allowed to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments and that meet the requirements in paragraphs 2 to 6 of this Article and in Article 367(1) and (3), Article 368, Article 369(1) and points (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 370.


**2.** Institutions shall use this internal model to calculate a number which adequately measures all price risks at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.


**3.** The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1:
- (a)the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products;
- (b)credit spread risk, including the gamma and cross-gamma effects;
- (c)volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations;
- (d)basis risk, including both of the following:(i)the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names;(ii)the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios;
- (e)recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices;
- (f)to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges;
- (g)any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio.


**4.** An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article. It shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authority through back testing or other appropriate means that its model can appropriately explain the historical price variation of those products.The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission.


**5.** With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution's own funds requirement in accordance with this Article. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of stress scenarios for the correlation trading portfolio.


**6.** The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.


# Article 378

**Settlement/delivery risk**

*Article 378*

In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed.The price difference is calculated as the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution.The institution shall multiply that price difference by the appropriate factor in the right column of the following Table 1 in order to calculate the institution's own funds requirement for settlement risk.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Number of working days after due settlement date | (%) | 
| 5 — 15 | 8 | 
| 16 — 30 | 50 | 
| 31 — 45 | 75 | 
| 46 or more | 100 |
# Article 379

**Free deliveries**

*Article 379*


**1.** An institution shall be required to hold own funds, as set out in Table 2, where the following occurs:
- (a)it has paid for securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving them or it has delivered securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving payment for them;
- (b)in the case of cross-border transactions, one day or more has elapsed since it made that payment or delivery.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | 
| Transaction Type | Up to first contractual payment or delivery leg | From first contractual payment or delivery leg up to four days after second contractual payment or delivery leg | From 5 business days post second contractual payment or delivery leg until extinction of the transaction | 
| Free delivery | No capital charge | Treat as an exposure | Treat as an exposure risk weighted at 1 250 % |


**2.** In applying a risk weight to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may assign PDs to counterparties, for which it has no other non-trading book exposure, on the basis of the counterparty's external rating. Institutions using own estimates of "LGDs" may apply the LGD set out in Article 161(1) to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2 provided that they apply it to all such exposures. Alternatively, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may apply the risk weights of the Standardised Approach, as set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 provided that it applies them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures.If the amount of positive exposure resulting from free delivery transactions is not material, institutions may apply a risk weight of 100 % to these exposures, except where a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1 is required.


**3.** As an alternative to applying a risk weight of 1 250 % to free delivery exposures according to Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1, institutions may deduct the value transferred plus the current positive exposure of those exposures from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1).


# Article 380

**Waiver**

*Article 380*

Where a system wide failure of a settlement system, a clearing system or a CCP occurs, competent authorities may waive the own funds requirements calculated as set out in Articles 378 and 379 until the situation is rectified. In this case, the failure of a counterparty to settle a trade shall not be deemed a default for purposes of credit risk.
# Article 381

**Meaning of credit valuation adjustment**

*Article 381*

For the purposes of this Title and Chapter 6 of Title II, "credit valuation adjustment" or "CVA" means an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty. That adjustment reflects the current market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution, but does not reflect the current market value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.For the purposes of this Title, "CVA risk" means the risk of losses arising from changes in the value of CVA, calculated for the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty as set out in the first paragraph, due to movements in counterparty credit spread risk factors and in other risk factors embedded in the portfolio of transactions.
# Article 382

**Scope**

*Article 382*


**1.** An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with this Title for all OTC derivative instruments in respect of all of its business activities, other than credit derivatives recognised to reduce risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk.


**2.** An institution shall include in the calculation of own funds required by paragraph 1 securities financing transactions that are fair-valued under the accounting framework applicable to the institution where the institution’s CVA risk exposures arising from those transactions are material.


**3.** Transactions with a qualifying central counterparty and a client's transactions with a clearing member, when the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the client and a qualifying central counterparty and the transactions give rise to a trade exposure of the clearing member to the qualifying central counterparty, are excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk.


**4.** The following transactions shall be excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk:
- (a)transactions with non-financial counterparties as defined in point (9) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, or with non-financial counterparties established in a third country, where those transactions do not exceed the clearing threshold as specified in Article 10(3) and (4) of that Regulation;
- (aa)intragroup transactions entered into with non-financial counterparties as defined in Article 2, point (9), of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 which are part of the same group provided that all the following conditions are met:(i)the institution and the non-financial counterparties are included in the same consolidation on a full basis and are subject to supervision on a consolidated basis in accordance with Part One, Title II, Chapter 2;(ii)they are subject to appropriate centralised risk evaluation, measurement and control procedures; and(iii)the non-financial counterparties are established in the Union or, if they are established in a third country, the Commission has adopted an implementing act in accordance with paragraph 4c in respect of that third country;
- (b)intragroup transactions entered into with financial counterparties, as defined in Article 2, point (8), of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, financial institutions or ancillary services undertakings that are established in the Union or that are established in a third country that applies prudential and supervisory requirements to those financial counterparties, financial institutions or ancillary services undertakings that are at least equivalent to those applied in the Union, unless Member States adopt national law requiring the structural separation within a banking group, in which case the competent authorities may require those intragroup transactions between the structurally separated entities to be included in the own funds requirements;
- (c)transactions with counterparties referred to in point (10) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and subject to the transitional provisions set out in Article 89(1) of that Regulation until those transitional provisions cease to apply;
- (d)transactions with counterparties referred to in Article 1(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and transactions with counterparties for which Article 114(4) and Article 115(2) of this Regulation specifies a risk weight of 0 % for exposures to those counterparties.The exemption from the CVA risk charge for those transactions referred to in point (c) of this paragraph) which are entered into during the transitional period laid down in Article 89(1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 shall apply for the length of the contract of that transaction.In regard to point (a), where an institution ceases to be exempt through crossing the exemption threshold or due to a change in the exemption threshold, outstanding contracts shall remain exempt until the date of their maturity.


**4a.** By way of derogation from paragraph 4 of this Article, an institution may choose to calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk, using any of the approaches referred to in Article 382a(1), for the transactions that are excluded pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, where the institution uses eligible hedges determined in accordance with Article 386 to mitigate the CVA risk of those transactions. Institutions shall establish policies to specify the application and calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk for such transactions.


**4b.** Institutions shall report to their competent authorities the results of the calculations of the own funds requirements for CVA risk for all transactions referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article. For the purposes of that reporting requirement, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the relevant approaches set out in Article 382a(1) that they would have used to satisfy an own funds requirement for CVA risk if those transactions were not excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.


**4c.** For the purposes of paragraph 4, points (aa) and (b), the Commission may adopt, by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether a third country applies prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.


**5.** EBA shall conduct a review by 1 January 2015 and every two years thereafter, in the light of international regulatory developments and including on potential methodologies on the calibration and thresholds for application of CVA risk charges to non-financial counterparties established in a third country.EBA in cooperation with ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the procedures for excluding transactions with non-financial counterparties established in a third country from the own funds requirement for CVA risk charge.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards within six months of the date of the review referred to in the first subparagraph,Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions and the criteria that institutions are to use to assess whether the CVA risk exposures arising from fair-valued securities financing transactions are material, as well as the frequency of that assessment.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 382a

**Approaches for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk**

*Article 382A*


**1.** An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk for all transactions referred to in Article 382 in accordance with the following approaches:
- (a)the standardised approach set out in Article 383, where the institution has been granted permission by the competent authority to use that approach;
- (b)the basic approach set out in Article 384;
- (c)the simplified approach set out in Article 385, provided that the institution meets the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of that Article.


**2.** An institution shall not use the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (c), in combination with the approach referred to in point (a) or (b) of that paragraph.


**3.** An institution may use a combination of the approaches referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), to calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk on a permanent basis for:
- (a)different counterparties;
- (b)different eligible netting sets with the same counterparty;
- (c)different transactions of the same eligible netting set, provided that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 5 are satisfied.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraph 3, point (c), institutions shall split the eligible netting set into a hypothetical netting set containing the transactions subject to the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), and a hypothetical netting set containing the transactions subject to the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b).


**5.** For the purposes of paragraph 3, point (c), the conditions referred to therein shall comprise the following:
- (a)the split is consistent with the treatment of the legal netting set when calculating the CVA for accounting purposes;
- (b)the permission granted by competent authorities to use the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), is limited to the corresponding hypothetical netting set and does not cover all transactions within the eligible netting set.Institutions shall document how they use a combination of the approaches referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), and as set out in this paragraph, to calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk on a permanent basis.


# Article 383

**Standardised approach**

*Article 383*


**1.** The competent authority shall grant an institution permission to calculate its own funds requirements for CVA risk for a portfolio of transactions with one or more counterparties by using the standardised approach in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, after having assessed whether the institution complies with the following requirements:
- (a)the institution has established a distinct unit which is responsible for the institution’s overall risk management and hedging of CVA risk;
- (b)for each counterparty concerned, the institution has developed a regulatory CVA model to calculate the CVA of that counterparty in accordance with Article 383a;
- (c)for each counterparty concerned, the institution is able to calculate, at least on a monthly basis, the sensitivities of its CVA to the risk factors concerned as determined in accordance with Article 383b;
- (d)for all positions in eligible hedges recognised in accordance with Article 386 for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach, the institution is able to calculate, and at least on a monthly basis, the sensitivities of those positions to the relevant risk factors determined in accordance with Article 383b;
- (e)the institution has established a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and the unit referred to in point (a) and that reports directly to the management body; that risk control unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing the standardised approach and shall produce and analyse monthly reports on the output of that approach and, moreover, the risk control unit shall assess the appropriateness of the institution’s trading limits and include the results of that assessment in its monthly reports; the risk control unit shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to fulfil its purpose.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), of this paragraph the sensitivity of a counterparty’s CVA to a risk factor means the relative change in the value of that CVA, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of that CVA, calculated using the institution’s regulatory CVA model in accordance with Articles 383i and 383j.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), of this paragraph the sensitivity of a position in an eligible hedge to a risk factor means the relative change in the value of that position, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of that position, calculated using the institution’s pricing model in accordance with Articles 383i and 383j.


**2.** For the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk, the following definitions apply:
- (1)"risk class" means any of the following categories:(a)interest rate risk;(b)counterparty credit spread risk;(c)reference credit spread risk;(d)equity risk;(e)commodity risk;(f)foreign exchange risk;
- (2)"CVA portfolio" means the portfolio composed of the aggregate CVA and the eligible hedges referred to in paragraph 1, point (d);
- (3)"aggregate CVA" means the sum of the CVAs calculated using the regulatory CVA model for the counterparties referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph.


**3.** Institutions shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach as the sum of the following own funds requirements calculated in accordance with Article 383b:
- (a)the own funds requirements for delta risk which capture the risk of changes in the institution’s CVA portfolio due to movements in the relevant non-volatility related risk factors;
- (b)the own funds requirements for vega risk which capture the risk of changes in the institution’s CVA portfolio due to movements in the relevant volatility related risk factors.


# Article 383a

**Regulatory CVA model**

*Article 383A*


**1.** A regulatory CVA model used for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 383 shall be conceptually sound, implemented with integrity, and comply with all of the following requirements:
- (a)the regulatory CVA model is capable of modelling the CVA of a given counterparty, recognising netting and margin agreements at netting set level, where relevant, in accordance with this Article;
- (b)the institution estimates the counterparty’s probabilities of default from the counterparty credit spreads and market-consensus expected loss given default for that counterparty;
- (c)the expected loss given default referred to in point (a) shall be the same as the market-consensus expected loss given default referred to in point (b), unless the institution can demonstrate that the seniority of the portfolio of transactions with that counterparty differs from the seniority of senior unsecured bonds issued by that counterparty;
- (d)at each future time point, the simulated discounted future exposure of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty is calculated with an exposure model by repricing all transactions in that portfolio, based on the simulated joint changes of the market risk factors that are material to those transactions using an appropriate number of scenarios, and discounting the prices to the date of calculation using risk-free interest rates;
- (e)the regulatory CVA model is capable of modelling significant dependency between the simulated discounted future exposure of the portfolio of transactions and the counterparty credit spreads;
- (f)where the transactions of the portfolio are included in a netting set subject to a margin agreement and daily mark-to-market valuation, the collateral posted and received as part of that agreement is recognised as a risk mitigant in the simulated discounted future exposure, where all of the following conditions are met:(i)the institution determines the margin period of risk relevant for that netting set in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 285(2) and (5), and reflects that margin period in the calculation of the simulated discounted future exposure;(ii)all applicable features of the margin agreement, including the frequency of margin calls, the type of contractually eligible collateral, the threshold amounts, the minimum transfer amounts, the independent amounts and the initial margins for both the institution and the counterparty are appropriately reflected in the calculation of the simulated discounted future exposure;(iii)the institution has established a collateral management unit that complies with Article 287 for all collateral recognised for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), CVA shall have a positive sign and shall be calculated as a function of the counterparty’s expected loss given default, an appropriate set of the counterparty’s probabilities of default at future time points and an appropriate set of simulated discounted future exposures of the portfolio of transactions with that counterparty at future time points until the maturity of the longest transaction in that portfolio.For the purposes of the demonstration referred to in the first subparagraph, point (c), collateral received from the counterparty shall not change the seniority of the exposure.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (f)(iii), of this paragraph where the institution has already established a collateral management unit for using the internal model method referred to in Article 283, the institution shall not be required to establish an additional collateral management unit where that institution demonstrates to its competent authority that such a unit complies with the requirements set out in Article 287 for the collateral recognised for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach.


**2.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (b), where the credit default swap spreads of the counterparty are observable in the market, an institution shall use those spreads. Where such credit default swap spreads are not available, an institution shall use one of the following:
- (a)credit spreads from other instruments issued by the counterparty reflecting current market conditions;
- (b)proxy spreads that are appropriate considering the rating, industry and region of the counterparty.


**3.** An institution using a regulatory CVA model shall comply with all of the following qualitative requirements:
- (a)the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 is part of the institution’s internal CVA risk management system that includes the identification, measurement, management, approval and internal reporting of CVA and CVA risk for accounting purposes;
- (b)the institution has in place a process for ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies, controls, assessment of model performance and procedures concerning the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1;
- (c)the institution shall have an independent validation unit that is responsible for the effective initial and ongoing validation of the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article; that unit shall be independent from business credit and trading units, including the unit referred to in Article 383(1), point (a), and report directly to senior management; it shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to fulfil that purpose;
- (d)the senior management shall be actively involved in the risk control process and shall regard CVA risk control as an essential aspect of the business, to which appropriate resources need to be devoted;
- (e)the institution shall document the process for initial and ongoing validation of the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 to a level of detail that would enable a third party to understand how the models operate, their limitations, and their key assumptions, and recreate the analysis; that documentation shall set out the minimum frequency with which ongoing validation will be conducted, as well as other circumstances, such as a sudden change in market behaviour, under which additional validation shall be conducted; it shall describe how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios, what analyses are used and how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed;
- (f)the pricing models used in the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 for a given scenario of simulated market risk factors shall be tested against appropriate independent benchmarks for a wide range of market states as part of the initial and ongoing model validation process; pricing models for options shall account for the non-linearity of option value with respect to market risk factors;
- (g)an independent review of the institution’s internal CVA risk management system referred to in point (a) of this paragraph shall be carried out by the institution’s internal auditing process on a regular basis; that review shall include the activities both of the unit referred to in Article 383(1), point (a), and of the independent validation unit referred to in point (c) of this paragraph;
- (h)the regulatory CVA model used by the institution for calculating the simulated discounted future exposure referred to in paragraph 1, shall reflect transaction terms and specifications and margin agreements in a timely, complete, and conservative manner; the terms and specifications shall reside in a secure database subject to formal and periodic audit; the transmission of transaction terms and specifications data and margin agreements to the exposure model shall also be subject to internal audit, and formal reconciliation processes shall be in place between the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms, specifications and margin agreements are being reflected in the exposure system correctly or, at least, conservatively;
- (i)the current and historical market data inputs used in the model by the institution for calculating the simulated discounted future exposure referred to in paragraph 1 shall be acquired independently of the business lines and fed into that model in a timely and complete manner and maintained in a secure database subject to formal and periodic audit; an institution shall have a well-developed data integrity process to handle inappropriate data observations; where the model relies on proxy market data, an institution shall design internal policies to identify suitable proxies and shall demonstrate empirically on an ongoing basis that the proxies provide a conservative representation of the underlying risk;
- (j)the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 shall capture the transaction specific and contractual information necessary in order to aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set; an institution shall verify that transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model.For the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk, the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may have different specifications and assumptions in order to meet all requirements laid down in Article 383a, except that its market data inputs and netting recognition shall remain the same as the ones used for accounting purposes.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)how proxy spreads referred to in paragraph 2, point (b), are to be determined by the institution for the purposes of calculating default probabilities;
- (b)further technical elements that institutions are to take into account when calculating the counterparty’s expected loss given default, the counterparty’s probabilities of default and the simulated discounted future exposure of the portfolio of transactions with that counterparty and CVA, as referred to in paragraph 1;
- (c)which other instruments referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), are appropriate to estimate the counterparty’s probabilities of default and how institutions are to make that estimate.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2027.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**5.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes to the use of the standardised approach as referred to in Article 383(3);
- (b)the assessment methodology under which competent authorities are to verify an institution’s compliance with the requirements set out in Articles 383 and 383a.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2028.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 383b

**Own funds requirements for delta and vega risks**

*Article 383B*


**1.** Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in Articles 383c to 383h, and the process set out in paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article, to calculate the own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.


**2.** For each risk class referred to in Article 383(2), the sensitivity of the aggregate CVAs and the sensitivity of all positions in eligible hedges falling within the scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risk to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulae set out in Articles 383i and 383j. Where the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor.For the calculation of the vega risk sensitivities of the aggregate CVAs, sensitivities both to volatilities used in the exposure model to simulate risk factors and to volatilities used to reprice option transactions in the portfolio with the counterparty shall be included.By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, subject to the permission of the competent authority, an institution may use alternative definitions of delta and vega risk sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets all of the following conditions:
- (a)those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes or for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;
- (b)the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities of the position than the formulae set out in Articles 383i and 383j, and that the resulting delta and vega risk sensitivities do not materially differ from the ones obtained applying the formulae set out in Articles 383i and 383j, respectively.


**3.** Where an eligible hedge is an index instrument, institutions shall calculate the sensitivities of that eligible hedge to all relevant risk factors by applying the shift of one of the relevant risk factors to each of the index constituents.


**4.** An institution may introduce additional risk factors that correspond to qualified index instruments for the following risk classes:
- (a)counterparty credit spread risk;
- (b)reference credit spread risk; and
- (c)equity risk.For the purposes of delta risks, an index instrument shall be considered qualified where it meets the conditions set out in Article 325i. For vega risks, all index instruments shall be considered qualified.An institution shall calculate sensitivities of CVA and eligible hedges to qualified index risk factors in addition to sensitivities to the non-index risk factors.An institution shall calculate delta and vega risk sensitivities to a qualified index risk factor as a single sensitivity to the underlying qualified index. Where 75 % of the constituents of a qualified index are mapped to the same sector as set out in Articles 383p, 383s and 383v, the institution shall map the qualified index to that same sector. Otherwise, the institution shall map the sensitivity to the applicable qualified index bucket.


**5.** The weighted sensitivities of the aggregate CVA and of the market value of all eligible hedges to each risk factor shall be calculated by multiplying the respective net sensitivities by the corresponding risk weight, in accordance with the following formulae:

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.013701.fmx.tif]*

  

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.013702.fmx.tif]*

  where:
- **
*k***: = the index that denotes the risk factor k;
- **

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.013703.fmx.tif]*

  **: = the weighted sensitivity of the aggregate CVA to risk factor k;
- **
*RWk***: = the risk weight applicable to the risk factor k;
- **

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.013704.fmx.tif]*

  **: = the net sensitivity of the aggregate CVA to risk factor k;
- **

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.013705.fmx.tif]*

  **: = the weighted sensitivity of the market value of all eligible hedges in the CVA portfolio to risk factor k;
- **

*[Formula: L_202401623EN.013706.fmx.tif]*

- (b)instruments that hedge variability of the exposure component of CVA risk, with the exception of the instruments referred to in Article 325(5).


**3.** For the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 384, only positions in the following hedging instruments shall be recognised as eligible hedges:
- (a)single-name credit default swaps and single-name contingent-credit default swaps, referencing:(i)the counterparty directly;(ii)an entity legally related to the counterparty, where legally related refers to cases where the reference name and the counterparty are either a parent undertaking and its subsidiary or two subsidiaries of a common parent;(iii)an entity that belongs to the same sector and region as the counterparty;
- (b)index credit default swaps.


**4.** Positions in hedging instruments entered into with third parties that are recognised as eligible hedges in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 and included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk shall not be subject to the own funds requirements for market risk set out in Title IV.


**5.** Positions in hedging instruments that are not recognised as eligible hedges in accordance with this Article shall be subject to the own funds requirements for market risk set out in Title IV.

# Article 389

**Definition**

*Article 389*

For the purposes of this Part, "exposures", means any asset or off-balance sheet item referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2, without applying the risk weights or degrees of risk.
# Article 390

**Calculation of the exposure value**

*Article 390*


**1.** The total exposures to a group of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures to individual clients in that group.


**2.** The overall exposures to individual clients shall be calculated by adding the exposures in the trading book and the exposures in the non-trading book.


**3.** For exposures in the trading book, institutions may:
- (a)offset their long positions and short positions in the same financial instruments issued by a given client, with the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated in accordance with the methods laid down in Chapter 2 of Title IV of Part Three;
- (b)offset their long positions and short positions in different financial instruments issued by a given client, but only where the financial instrument underlying the short position is junior to the financial instrument underlying the long position or where the underlying instruments are of the same seniority.For the purposes of points (a) and (b), financial instruments may be allocated into buckets on the basis of different degrees of seniority in order to determine the relative seniority of positions.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate the exposure values of the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivative contracts directly entered into with a client in accordance with one of the methods set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three, as applicable. Exposures resulting from the transactions referred to in Articles 378, 379 and 380 shall be calculated in the manner laid down in those Articles.When calculating the exposure value for the contracts referred to in the first subparagraph, where those contracts are allocated to the trading book, institutions shall also comply with the principles set out in Article 299.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, institutions with permission to use the methods referred to in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three and Section 6 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three may use those methods for calculating the exposure value for securities financing transactions.


**5.** Institutions shall add to the total exposure to a client the exposures arising from derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivative contracts, where the contract was not directly entered into with that client but the underlying debt or equity instrument was issued by that client.


**6.** Exposures shall not include any of the following:
- (a)in the case of foreign exchange transactions, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the two business days following payment;
- (b)in the case of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the five business days following payment or delivery of the securities, whichever is the earlier;
- (c)in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking or financial instruments clearing, settlement and custody services to clients, delayed receipts in funding and other exposures arising from client activity which do not last longer than the following business day;
- (d)in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking, intra-day exposures to institutions providing those services;
- (e)exposures deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 items or Additional Tier 1 items in accordance with Articles 36 and 56 or any other deduction from those items that reduces the solvency ratio.


**7.** To determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients, in respect of clients to which the institution has exposures through transactions referred to in points (m) and (o) of Article 112 or through other transactions where there is an exposure to underlying assets, an institution shall assess its underlying exposures taking into account the economic substance of the structure of the transaction and the risks inherent in the structure of the transaction itself, in order to determine whether it constitutes an additional exposure.


**8.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
- (a)the conditions and methodologies to be used to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients for the types of exposures referred to in paragraph 7;
- (b)the conditions under which the structure of the transactions referred to in paragraph 7 do not constitute an additional exposure.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**9.** For the purposes of paragraph 5, EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how to determine the exposures arising from derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivative contracts, where the contract was not directly entered into with a client but the underlying debt or equity instrument was issued by that client for their inclusion into the exposures to the client.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 391

**Definition of an institution for large exposures purposes**

*Article 391*

For the purposes of calculating the value of exposures in accordance with this Part the term "institution" shall include a private or public undertaking, including its branches, which, were it established in the Union, would fulfil the definition of the term "institution" and has been authorised in a third country that applies prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.For the purposes of the first paragraph, the Commission may adopt, by means of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), decisions as to whether a third country applies prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.
# Article 392

**Definition of a large exposure**

*Article 392*

An institution's exposure to a client or a group of connected clients shall be considered a large exposure where the value of the exposure is equal to or exceeds 10 % of its Tier 1 capital.
# Article 393

**Capacity to identify and manage large exposures**

*Article 393*

An institution shall have sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms for the purposes of identifying, managing, monitoring, reporting and recording all large exposures and subsequent changes to them, in accordance with this Regulation.
# Article 394

**Reporting requirements**

*Article 394*


**1.** Institutions shall report the following information to their competent authorities for each large exposure that they hold, including large exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1):
- (a)the identity of the client or the group of connected clients to which the institution has a large exposure;
- (b)the exposure value before taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation, where applicable;
- (c)where used, the type of funded or unfunded credit protection;
- (d)the exposure value, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation calculated for the purposes of Article 395(1), where applicable.Institutions that are subject to Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three shall report their 20 largest exposures to their competent authorities on a consolidated basis, excluding the exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1).Institutions shall also report exposures of a value greater than or equal to EUR 300 million but less than 10 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital to their competent authorities on a consolidated basis.


**2.** In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report the following information to their competent authorities in relation to their 10 largest exposures to institutions on a consolidated basis, as well as their 10 largest exposures to shadow banking entities on a consolidated basis, including large exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1):
- (a)the identity of the client or the group of connected clients to which an institution has a large exposure;
- (b)the exposure value before taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation, where applicable;

**3.** Institutions shall report the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to their competent authorities on at least a semi-annual basis.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria for the identification of shadow banking entities referred to in paragraph 2.In developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into account international developments and internationally agreed standards on shadow banking and shall consider whether:
- (a)the relation with an individual entity or a group of entities may carry risks to the institution's solvency or liquidity position;
- (b)entities that are subject to solvency or liquidity requirements similar to those imposed by this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU should be entirely or partially excluded from the obligation to be reported referred to in paragraph 2 on shadow banking entities.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2020.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 395

**Limits to large exposures**

*Article 395*


**1.** An institution shall not incur an exposure to a client or group of connected clients the value of which exceeds 25 % of its Tier 1 capital, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403. Where that client is an institution or an investment firm, or where a group of connected clients includes one or more institutions or investment firms, that value shall not exceed 25 % of the institution’s Tier 1 capital or EUR 150 million, whichever is higher, provided that the sum of exposure values, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, to all connected clients that are not institutions or investment firms, does not exceed 25 % of the institution’s Tier 1 capital.Where the amount of EUR 150 million is higher than 25 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital, the value of the exposure, after having taken into account the effect of credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 of this Regulation, shall not exceed a reasonable limit in terms of that institution's Tier 1 capital. That limit shall be determined by the institution in accordance with the policies and procedures referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU in order to address and control concentration risk. That limit shall not exceed 100 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital.Competent authorities may set a lower limit than EUR 150 million, in which case they shall inform EBA and the Commission thereof.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, a G-SII shall not incur an exposure to another G-SII or a non-EU G-SII, the value of which, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, exceeds 15 % of its Tier 1 capital. A G-SII shall comply with such limit no later than 12 months from the date on which it came to be identified as a G-SII. Where the G-SII has an exposure to another institution or group which comes to be identified as a G-SII or as a non-EU G-SII, it shall comply with such limit no later than 12 months from the date on which that other institution or group came to be identified as a G-SII or as a non-EU G-SII.


**2.** EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 as well as the outcomes of developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures at the Union and international levels, issue guidelines by 31 December 2014 to set appropriate aggregate limits to such exposures or tighter individual limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework.In developing those guidelines, EBA shall consider whether the introduction of additional limits would have a material detrimental impact on the risk profile of institutions established in the Union, on the provision of credit to the real economy or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets.By 31 December 2015 the Commission shall assess the appropriateness and the impact of imposing limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework, taking into account Union and international developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures as well as credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and the Council, together, if appropriate, with a legislative proposal on exposure limits to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework.


**2a.** By 10 January 2027, EBA, after consulting ESMA, shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to update the guidelines referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.In updating those guidelines, EBA shall take due account, among other considerations, of the contribution of shadow banking entities to the capital markets union, the potential adverse impact that any changes of those guidelines, including additional limits, could have on the business model and risk profile of the institutions and on the stability and the orderly functioning of financial markets.In addition, by 31 December 2027, EBA, after consulting ESMA, shall submit a report to the Commission on the contribution of shadow banking entities to the capital markets union and on institutions’ exposures to such entities, including on the appropriateness of aggregate limits or tighter individual limits to those exposures, while taking due account of the regulatory framework and business models of such entities.By 31 December 2028, the Commission shall, where appropriate, on the basis of that report, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal on exposure limits to shadow banking entities.


**3.** Subject to Article 396, an institution shall at all times comply with the relevant limit laid down in paragraph 1.


**4.** Assets constituting claims and other exposures onto recognised third-country investment firms may be subject to the same treatment as set out in paragraph 1.


**5.** The limits laid down in this Article may be exceeded for the exposures in the institution's trading book, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the exposure in the non-trading book to the client or group of connected clients in question does not exceed the limit laid down in paragraph 1, this limit being calculated with reference to Tier 1 capital, so that the excess arises entirely in the trading book;
- (b)the institution meets an additional own funds requirement on the part of the exposure in excess of the limit laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article which is calculated in accordance with Articles 397 and 398;
- (c)where 10 days or less have elapsed since the excess referred to in point (b) occurred, the trading-book exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question does not exceed 500 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital;
- (d)any excesses that have persisted for more than 10 days do not, in aggregate, exceed 600 % of the institution's Tier 1 capital.Each time the limit has been exceeded, the institution shall report to the competent authorities without delay the amount of the excess and the name of the client concerned and, where applicable, the name of the group of connected clients concerned.


**6.** For the purpose of this paragraph, structural measures mean measures adopted by a Member State and implemented by the relevant competent authorities of that Member State before the entry into force of a legal act explicitly harmonising such measures, that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability.Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 400(1)(f), where Member States adopt national laws requiring structural measures to be taken within a banking group, competent authorities may require the institutions of the banking group which hold deposits that are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country to apply a large exposure limit below 25 % but not lower than 15 % between 28 June 2013 and 30 June 2015, and than 10 % from 1 July 2015 on a sub-consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(5) to intragroup exposures where these exposures consist of exposures to an entity that does not belong to the same subgroup as regards the structural measures.For the purpose of this paragraph, the following conditions shall be met:
- (a)all entities belonging to a same subgroup as regards the structural measures are considered as one client or group of connected clients;
- (b)the competent authorities apply a uniform limit to the exposures referred to in the first subparagraph.Applying this approach shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole or form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.


**7.** Before adopting the specific structural measures as referred to in paragraph 6 relating to large exposures, the competent authorities shall notify the Council, the Commission, the competent authorities concerned and EBA at least two months prior to the publication of the decision to adopt the structural measures, and submit relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence of all of the following:
- (a)the scope of the activities that are subject to the structural measures;
- (b)an explanation as to why such draft measures are deemed to be suitable, effective and proportionate to protect depositors;
- (c)an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State.


**8.** The power to adopt an implementing act to accept or reject the proposed national measures referred to in paragraph 7 is conferred on the Commission acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 464(2).Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 7, EBA shall provide its opinion on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned. Competent authorities concerned may also provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned.Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust and strong evidence that the measures have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits, the Commission shall, within two months of receiving the notification, reject the proposed national measures. Otherwise, the Commission shall accept the proposed national measures for an initial period of 2 years and where appropriate the measures may be subject to amendment.The Commission shall only reject the proposed national measures if it considers the proposed national measures entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market or to the free movement of capital in accordance with the provisions of the TFEU.The assessment of the Commission shall take account of the opinion of EBA and shall take into account the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 7.Before the expiry of the measures, the competent authorities may propose new measures for the extension of the period of application for an additional period of 2 years each time. In this case, they shall notify the Commission, the Council, the competent authorities concerned and EBA. Approval of the new measures shall be subject to the process set out in this Article. This Article shall be without prejudice to Article 458.


# Article 396

**Compliance with large exposures requirements**

*Article 396*


**1.** If, in an exceptional case, exposures exceed the limit set out in Article 395(1), the institution shall report the value of the exposure without delay to the competent authorities which may, where the circumstances warrant it, allow the institution a limited period of time in which to comply with the limit.Where the amount of EUR 150 million referred to in Article 395(1) is applicable, the competent authorities may allow the 100 % limit in terms of the institution's Tier 1 capital to be exceeded on a case-by-case basis.Where, in the exceptional cases referred to in the first and second subparagraph of this paragraph, a competent authority allows an institution to exceed the limit set out in Article 395(1) for a period longer than three months, the institution shall present a plan for a timely return to compliance with that limit to the satisfaction of the competent authority and shall carry out that plan within the period agreed with the competent authority. The competent authority shall monitor the implementation of the plan and shall require a more rapid return to compliance if appropriate.


**2.** Where compliance by an institution on an individual or sub-consolidated basis with the obligations imposed in this Part is waived under Article 7(1), or the provisions of Article 9 are applied in the case of parent institutions in a Member State, measures shall be taken to ensure the satisfactory allocation of risks within the group.


**3.** For the purposes of paragraph 1, EBA shall issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to specify how the competent authorities may determine:
- (a)the exceptional cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article;
- (b)the time considered appropriate for returning to compliance;
- (c)the measures to be taken to ensure the timely return to compliance of the institution.


# Article 397

**Calculating additional own funds requirements for large exposures in the trading book**

*Article 397*


**1.** The excess referred to in Article 395(5)(b) shall be calculated by selecting those components of the total trading exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question which attract the highest specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V, the sum of which equals the amount of the excess referred to in point (a) of Article 395(5).


**2.** Where the excess has not persisted for more than 10 days, the additional capital requirement shall be 200 % of the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, on these components.


**3.** As from 10 days after the excess has occurred, the components of the excess, selected in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be allocated to the appropriate line in Column 1 of Table 1 in ascending order of specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V. The additional own funds requirement shall be equal to the sum of the specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or the Article 299 and Part Three, Title V requirements on these components, multiplied by the corresponding factor in Column 2 of Table 1.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | 
| --- | --- |
| Column 1: Excess over the limits(on the basis of a percentage of Tier 1 capital) | Column 2: Factors | 
| Up to 40 % | 200 % | 
| From 40 % to 60 % | 300 % | 
| From 60 % to 80 % | 400 % | 
| From 80 % to 100 % | 500 % | 
| From 100 % to 250 % | 600 % | 
| Over 250 % | 900 % |


# Article 398

**Procedures to prevent institutions from avoiding the additional own funds requirement**

*Article 398*

Institutions shall not deliberately avoid the additional own funds requirements set out in Article 397 that they would otherwise incur, on exposures exceeding the limit laid down in Article 395(1) once those exposures have been maintained for more than 10 days, by means of temporarily transferring the exposures in question to another company, whether within the same group or not, and/or by undertaking artificial transactions to close out the exposure during the 10-day period and create a new exposure.Institutions shall maintain systems which ensure that any transfer which has the effect referred to in the first subparagraph is immediately reported to the competent authorities.
# Article 399

**Eligible credit mitigation techniques**

*Article 399*


**1.** An institution shall use a credit risk mitigation technique in the calculation of an exposure where it has used that technique to calculate capital requirements for credit risk in accordance with Title II of Part Three, provided that the credit risk mitigation technique meets the conditions set out in this Article.For the purposes of Articles 400 to 403, the term "guarantee" shall include credit derivatives recognised under Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three other than credit linked notes.


**2.** Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, where, under Articles 400 to 403 the recognition of funded or unfunded credit protection is permitted, this shall be subject to compliance with the eligibility requirements and other requirements set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.


**3.** Credit risk mitigation techniques which are available only to institutions using one of the IRB approaches shall not be used to reduce exposure values for large exposure purposes, except for exposures secured by immovable properties in accordance with Article 402.


**4.** Institutions shall analyse, to the extent possible, their exposures to collateral issuers, providers of unfunded credit protection and underlying assets pursuant to Article 390(7) for possible concentrations and where appropriate take action and report any significant findings to their competent authority.


# Article 400

**Exemptions**

*Article 400*


**1.** The following exposures shall be exempted from the application of Article 395(1):

- (j)legally required guarantees used when a mortgage loan financed by issuing mortgage bonds is paid to the mortgage borrower before the final registration of the mortgage in the land register, provided that the guarantee is not used as reducing the risk in calculating the risk -weighted exposure amounts;
- (k)exposures in the form of a collateral or a guarantee for residential loans, provided by an eligible protection provider referred to in Article 201 qualifying for the credit rating which is at least the lower of the following:(i)credit quality step 2;(ii)the credit quality step corresponding to the central government foreign currency rating of the Member State where the protection provider's headquarters are located;
- (l)exposures in the form of a guarantee for officially supported export credits, provided by an export credit agency qualifying for the credit rating which is at least the lower of the following:(i)credit quality step 2;(ii)the credit quality step corresponding to the central government foreign currency rating of the Member State where the export credit agency's headquarters are located.


**3.** Competent authorities may only make use of the exemption provided for in paragraph 2 where the following conditions are met:
- (a)the specific nature of the exposure, the counterparty or the relationship between the institution and the counterparty eliminate or reduce the risk of the exposure; and
- (b)any remaining concentration risk can be addressed by other equally effective means such as the arrangements, processes and mechanisms provided for in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU.Competent authorities shall inform EBA of whether they intend to use any of the exemptions provided for in paragraph 2 in accordance with points (a) and (b) of this paragraph and provide EBA with the reasons substantiating the use of those exemptions.

# Article 401

**Calculating the effect of the use of credit risk mitigation techniques**

*Article 401*


**1.** For calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1), an institution may use the fully adjusted exposure value (E*) as calculated under Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three, taking into account the credit risk mitigation, volatility adjustments and any maturity mismatch referred to in that Chapter.


**2.** With the exception of institutions using the Financial Collateral Simple Method, for the purposes of the first paragraph, institutions shall use the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method, regardless of the method used for calculating the own funds requirements for credit risk.By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions with permission to use the methods referred to in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three and Section 6 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three, may use those methods for calculating the exposure value of securities financing transactions.


**3.** In calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1), institutions shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit-risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken.The periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions' adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations.The stress tests carried out shall be adequate and appropriate for the assessment of those risks.Institutions shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk:
- (a)policies and procedures to address risks arising from maturity mismatches between exposures and any credit protection on those exposures;
- (b)policies and procedures relating to concentration risk arising from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, in particular from large indirect credit exposures, for example, exposures to a single issuer of securities taken as collateral.


**4.** Where an institution reduces an exposure to a client using an eligible credit risk mitigation technique in accordance with Article 399(1), the institution, in the manner set out in Article 403, shall treat the part of the exposure by which the exposure to the client has been reduced as having been incurred for the protection provider rather than for the client.


# Article 402

**Exposures arising from mortgage lending**

*Article 402*


**1.** For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, institutions may, except where prohibited by applicable national law, reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure that is secured by residential property in accordance with Article 125(1) by the pledged amount of the property value, but by not more than 55 % of the property value, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the competent authorities have not set a risk weight higher than 20 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by residential property in accordance with Article 124(9);
- (b)the exposure or part of the exposure is fully secured by any of the following:(i)one or more mortgages on residential property; or(ii)a residential property in a leasing transaction under which the lessor retains full ownership of the residential property and the lessee has not yet exercised his or her option to purchase;
- (c)the requirements laid down in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met.


**2.** For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, institutions may, except where prohibited by applicable national law, reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure that is secured by commercial immovable property in accordance with Article 126(1) by the pledged amount of the property value, but by not more than 55 % of the property value, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the competent authorities have not set a risk weight higher than 60 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by commercial immovable property in accordance with Article 124(9);
- (b)the exposure is fully secured by any of the following:(i)one or more mortgages on offices or other commercial premises; or(ii)one or more offices or other commercial premises and the exposures related to property leasing transactions;
- (c)the requirements in Article 124(3), point (c), and in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met;
- (d)the commercial immovable property is fully constructed.


**3.** An institution may treat an exposure to a counterparty that results from a reverse repurchase agreement under which the institution has purchased from the counterparty non-accessory independent mortgage liens on immovable property of third parties as a number of individual exposures to each of those third parties, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the counterparty is an institution or an investment firm;
- (b)the exposure is fully secured by liens on the immovable property of those third parties that have been purchased by the institution and the institution is able to exercise those liens;
- (c)the institution has ensured that the requirements in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met;
- (d)the institution becomes beneficiary of the claims that the counterparty has against the third parties in the event of default, insolvency or liquidation of the counterparty;
- (e)the institution reports to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 394 the total amount of exposures to each other institution or investment firm that are treated in accordance with this paragraph.For these purposes, the institution shall assume that it has an exposure to each of those third parties for the amount of the claim that the counterparty has on the third party instead of the corresponding amount of the exposure to the counterparty. The remainder of the exposure to the counter party, if any, shall continue to be treated as an exposure to the counter party.


# Article 403

**Substitution approach**

*Article 403*


**1.** Where an exposure to a client is guaranteed by a third party or is secured by collateral issued by a third party, an institution shall:
- (a)treat the portion of the exposure which is guaranteed as exposure to the guarantor rather than to the client, provided that the unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned a risk weight that is equal to or lower than the risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three;
- (b)treat the portion of the exposure collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral as exposure to the third party rather than to the client, provided that the exposure is secured by collateral and provided that the collateralised portion of the exposure would be assigned a risk weight that is equal to or lower than the risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three.The approach referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not be used by an institution where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection.For the purposes of this Part, an institution may use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph only where it is permitted to use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the Financial Collateral Simple Method for the purposes of Article 92.


**2.** Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1, the institution:
- (a)where the guarantee is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated, shall calculate the amount of the exposure that is deemed to be covered in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of currency mismatch for unfunded credit protection set out in Part Three;
- (b)shall treat any mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of maturity mismatch set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three;
- (c)may recognise partial coverage in accordance with the treatment set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three.


**3.** For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, an institution may replace the amount in point (a) of this paragraph with the amount in point (b) of this paragraph, provided that the conditions set out in points (c), (d) and (e) of this paragraph are met:
- (a)the total amount of the institution's exposure to a collateral issuer due to tri-party repurchase agreements facilitated by a tri-party agent;
- (b)the full amount of the limits that the institution has instructed the tri-party agent referred to in point (a) to apply to the securities issued by the collateral issuer referred to in that point;
- (c)the institution has verified that the tri-party agent has in place appropriate safeguards to prevent breaches of the limits referred to in point (b);
- (d)the competent authority has not expressed to the institution any material concerns;
- (e)the sum of the amount of the limit referred to in point (b) of this paragraph and any other exposures of the institution to the collateral issuer does not exceed the limit set out in Article 395(1).


**4.** EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, specifying the conditions for the application of the treatment referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, including the conditions and frequency for determining, monitoring and revising the limits referred to in point (b) of that paragraph.EBA shall publish those guidelines by 31 December 2019.


# Article 404

**Scope of application**

*Article 404*

Titles II and III shall apply to new securitisations issued on or after 1 January 2011. Titles II and III shall, after 31 December 2014, apply to existing securitisations where new underlying exposures are added or substituted after that date.
# Article 405

**Retained interest of the issuer**

*Article 405*


**1.** An institution, other than when acting as an originator, a sponsor or original lender, shall be exposed to the credit risk of a securitisation position in its trading book or non-trading book only if the originator, sponsor or original lender has explicitly disclosed to the institution that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall not be less than 5 %.Only any of the following qualifies as retention of a material net economic interest of not less than 5 %:
- (a)retention of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to the investors;
- (b)in the case of securitisations of revolving exposures, retention of the originator's interest of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures;
- (c)retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures, where such exposures would otherwise have been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures is no less than 100 at origination;
- (d)retention of the first loss tranche and, if necessary, other tranches having the same or a more severe risk profile than those transferred or sold to investors and not maturing any earlier than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals in total no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures;
- (e)retention of a first loss exposure not less than 5 % of every securitised exposure in the securitisation.Net economic interest is measured at the origination and shall be maintained on an ongoing basis. The net economic interest, including retained positions, interest or exposures, shall not be subject to any credit risk mitigation or any short positions or any other hedge and shall not be sold. The net economic interest shall be determined by the notional value for off-balance sheet items.There shall be no multiple applications of the retention requirements for any given securitisation.


**2.** Where an EU parent credit institution, an EU financial holding company, an EU mixed financial holding company or one of its subsidiaries, as an originator or a sponsor, securitises exposures from several credit institutions, investment firms or other financial institutions which are included in the scope of supervision on a consolidated basis, the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 may be satisfied on the basis of the consolidated situation of the related EU parent credit institution, EU financial holding company, or EU mixed financial holding company.The first subparagraph shall apply only where credit institutions, investment firms or financial institutions which created the securitised exposures have committed themselves to adhere to the requirements set out in Article 408 and deliver, in a timely manner, to the originator or sponsor and to the EU parent credit institution, EU financial holding company or EU mixed financial holding company the information needed to satisfy the requirements referred to in Article 409.


**3.** Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the securitised exposures are exposures on or fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the following entities:
- (a)central governments or central banks;
- (b)regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities of Member States;
- (c)institutions to which a 50 % risk weight or less is assigned under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;
- (d)multilateral development banks.


**4.** Paragraph 1 shall not apply to transactions based on a clear, transparent and accessible index, where the underlying reference entities are identical to those that make up an index of entities that is widely traded, or are other tradable securities other than securitisation positions.


# Article 406

**Due diligence**

*Article 406*


**1.** Before becoming exposed to the risks of a securitisation, and as appropriate thereafter, institutions shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authorities for each of their individual securitisation positions, that they have a comprehensive and thorough understanding of and have implemented formal policies and procedures appropriate to their trading book and non-trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions for analysing and recording:
- (a)information disclosed under Article 405(1), by originators, sponsors or original lenders to specify the net economic interest that they maintain, on an ongoing basis, in the securitisation;
- (b)the risk characteristics of the individual securitisation position;
- (c)the risk characteristics of the exposures underlying the securitisation position;
- (d)the reputation and loss experience in earlier securitisations of the originators or sponsors in the relevant exposure classes underlying the securitisation position;
- (e)the statements and disclosures made by the originators or sponsors, or their agents or advisors, about their due diligence on the securitised exposures and, where applicable, on the quality of the collateral supporting the securitised exposures;
- (f)where applicable, the methodologies and concepts on which the valuation of collateral supporting the securitised exposures is based and the policies adopted by the originator or sponsor to ensure the independence of the valuer;
- (g)all the structural features of the securitisation that can materially impact the performance of the institution's securitisation position, such as the contractual waterfall and waterfall related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, market value triggers, and deal-specific definitions of default.Institutions shall regularly perform their own stress tests appropriate to their securitisation positions. To this end, institutions may rely on financial models developed by an ECAI provided that institutions can demonstrate, when requested, that they took due care prior to investing to validate the relevant assumptions in and structuring of the models and to understand methodology, assumptions and results.


**2.** Institutions, other than when acting as originators or sponsors or original lenders, shall establish formal procedures appropriate to their trading book and non-trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner performance information on the exposures underlying their securitisation positions. Where relevant, this shall include the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, collateral type and occupancy, and frequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and geographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with band widths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Where the underlying exposures are themselves securitisation positions, institutions shall have the information set out in this subparagraph not only on the underlying securitisation tranches, such as the issuer name and credit quality, but also on the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying those securitisation tranches.Institutions shall also apply the same standards of analysis to participations or underwritings in securitisation issues purchased from third parties whether such participations or underwritings are to be held on their trading or non-trading book.


# Article 407

**Additional risk weight**

*Article 407*

Where an institution does not meet the requirements in Article 405, 406 or 409 in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the institution, the competent authorities shall impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight (capped at 1250 %) which shall apply to the relevant securitisation positions in the manner specified in Article 245(6) or Article 337(3) respectively. The additional risk weight shall progressively increase with each subsequent infringement of the due diligence provisions.The competent authorities shall take into account the exemptions for certain securitisations provided in Article 405(3) by reducing the risk weight it would otherwise impose under this Article in respect of a securitisation to which Article 405(3) applies.
# Article 408

**Criteria for credit granting**

*Article 408*

Sponsor and originator institutions shall apply the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting in accordance with the requirements of Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU to exposures to be securitised as they apply to exposures to be held in their own non-trading book. To this end the same processes for approving and, where relevant, amending, renewing and re-financing credits shall be applied by the originator and sponsor institutions.Where the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph of this Article are not met, Article 245(1) shall not be applied by an originator institution and that originator institution shall not be allowed to exclude the securitised exposures from the calculation of its capital requirements under this Regulation.
# Article 409

**Disclosure to investors**

*Article 409*

Institutions acting as an originator, a sponsor or original lender shall disclose to investors the level of their commitment under Article 405 to maintain a net economic interest in the securitisation. Sponsor and originator institutions shall ensure that prospective investors have readily available access to all materially relevant data on the credit quality and performance of the individual underlying exposures, cash flows and collateral supporting a securitisation exposure as well as such information that is necessary to conduct comprehensive and well informed stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying exposures. For that purpose, materially relevant data shall be determined as at the date of the securitisation and where appropriate due to the nature of the securitisation thereafter.
# Article 410

# Article 416

**Reporting on liquid assets**

*Article 416*


**1.** Institutions shall report the following as liquid assets unless excluded by paragraph 2 and only if the liquid assets fulfil the conditions in paragraph 3:
- (a)cash and exposures to central banks to the extent that these exposures can be withdrawn at any time in times of stress. As regards deposits held with central banks, the competent authority and the central bank shall aim at reaching a common understanding regarding the extent to which minimum reserves can be withdrawn in times of stress;
- (b)other transferable assets that are of extremely high liquidity and credit quality;
- (c)transferable assets representing claims on or guaranteed by:(i)the central government of a Member State, a region with fiscal autonomy to raise and collect taxes, or of a third country in the domestic currency of the central or regional government, if the institution incurs a liquidity risk in that Member State or third country that it covers by holding those liquid assets;(ii)central banks and non-central government public sector entities in the domestic currency of the central bank and the public sector entity;(iii)the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Commission and multilateral development banks;(iv)the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism;
- (d)transferable assets that are of high liquidity and credit quality;
- (e)standby credit facilities granted by central banks within the scope of monetary policy to the extent that these facilities are not collateralised by liquid assets and excluding emergency liquidity assistance;
- (f)if the credit institution belongs to a network in accordance with legal or statutory provisions, the legal or statutory minimum deposits with the central credit institution and other statutory or contractually available liquid funding from the central credit institution or institutions that are members of the network referred to in Article 113(7), or eligible for the waiver provided in Article 10, to the extent that this funding is not collateralised by liquid assets.Pending specification of a uniform definition in accordance with Article 460 of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality, institutions shall identify themselves in a given currency transferable assets that are respectively of high or extremely high liquidity and credit quality. Pending specification of a uniform definition, competent authorities may, taking into account the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5) provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying assets of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality. In the absence of such guidance, institutions shall use transparent and objective criteria to this end, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5).


**2.** The following shall not be considered liquid assets:
- (a)assets that are issued by a credit institution unless they fulfil one of the following conditions:(i)they are bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) or asset backed instruments if demonstrated to be of the highest credit quality as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509 (3), (4) and (5);(ii)they are covered bonds as defined in point (1) Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 other than those referred to in point (i) of this point;(iii)the credit institution has been set up by a Member State central or regional government and that government has an obligation to protect the economic basis of the institution and maintain its viability throughout its lifetime; or the asset is explicitly guaranteed by that government; or at least 90 % of the loans granted by the institution are directly or indirectly guaranteed by that government and the asset is predominantly used to fund promotional loans granted on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote that government's public policy objectives;
- (b)assets that are provided as collateral to the institution under reverse repo and securities financing transactions and that are held by the institution only as a credit risk mitigant and that are not legally and contractually available for use by the institution;
- (c)assets issued by any of the following:(i)an investment firm;(ii)an insurance undertaking;(iii)a financial holding company;(iv)a mixed financial holding company;(v)any other entity that performs one or more of the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU as its main business.


**3.** In accordance with paragraph 1, institutions shall report assets that fulfil the following conditions as liquid assets:
- (a)the assets are unencumbered or stand available within collateral pools to be used for obtaining additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution;
- (b)the assets are not issued by the institution itself, by its parent or subsidiary institutions, or by another subsidiary of its parent institution or parent financial holding company;
- (c)the price of the assets is generally agreed upon by market participants and can easily be observed in the market or the price can be determined by a formula that is easy to calculate on the basis of publicly available inputs and that does not depend on strong assumptions, as is typically the case for structured or exotic products;
- (d)the assets are listed on a recognised exchange or they are tradable by an outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on repurchase markets; those criteria shall be assessed separately for each market.The conditions referred to in points (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the assets referred to in points (a), (e) and (f) of paragraph 1.


**4.** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, pending the specification of a binding liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460 and in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report on:
- (a)other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets such as equities and gold based on transparent and objective criteria, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5);
- (b)other central bank eligible and tradable assets such as asset backed instruments of the highest credit quality as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509(3), (4) and (5);
- (c)other central bank eligible but non-tradable assets such as credit claims as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509(3), (4) and (5).


**5.** Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets, up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million or the equivalent amount in domestic currency, in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution, provided that the requirements laid down in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk.The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible for the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets.


**6.** Where a liquid asset ceases to comply with the requirement for liquid assets as set out in this Article, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 5, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days, provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.


**7.** Where a liquid asset ceases to be eligible in the stock of liquid assets, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 calendar days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 6, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.


# Article 417

**Operational requirements for holdings of liquid assets**

*Article 417*

The institution shall only report as liquid assets those holdings of liquid assets that meet the following conditions:
- (a)they are appropriately diversified. Diversification is not required in terms of assets corresponding to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
- (b)they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 416(1) which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question, unless the institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that it has appropriately hedged the ensuing currency risk;
- (c)the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function;
- (d)a portion of the liquid assets except those referred to in points (a), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 416(1) is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or via simple repurchase agreements on an approved repurchase market for the following purposes:
- (i)to test the access to the market for these assets;
- (ii)to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liquidation of assets;
- (iii)to test the usability of the assets;
- (iv)to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress;
- (e)price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they are readily available to the treasury when needed and especially that they are not used in other ongoing operations, including:
- (i)hedging or other trading strategies;
- (ii)providing credit enhancements in structured transactions;
- (iii)covering operational costs.
- (f)the denomination of the liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows.
# Article 418

**Valuation of liquid assets**

*Article 418*


**1.** The value of a liquid asset to be reported shall be its market value, subject to appropriate haircuts that reflect at least the duration, the credit and liquidity risk and typical repo haircuts in periods of general market stress. The haircuts shall not be less than 15 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1). If the institution hedges the price risk associated with an asset, it shall take into account the cash flow resulting from the potential close-out of the hedge.


**2.** Shares or units in CIUs as referred to in Article 416(6) shall be subject to haircuts, looking through to the underlying assets as follows:
- (a)0 % for the assets referred to in point (a) of Article 416(1);
- (b)5 % for the assets referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
- (c)20 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1).


**3.** The look-through approach referred to in paragraph 2 shall be applied as follows:
- (a)where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to assign them to points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1);
- (b)where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in descending order in the asset types referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1) until the maximum total investment limit is reached.


**4.** Institutions shall develop robust methodologies and processes to calculate and report the market value and haircuts for shares or units in CIUs. Only where they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the materiality of the exposure does not justify the development of their own methodologies, institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report the haircuts for shares or units in CIUs, in accordance with the methods set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3:
- (a)the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;
- (b)for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).The correctness of the calculations by the depository institution or the CIU management company shall be confirmed by an external auditor.


# Article 419

**Currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets**

*Article 419*


**1.** EBA shall assess the availability for institutions of the liquid assets referred to in point (b) of Article 416(1) in the currencies that are relevant for institutions established in the Union.


**2.** Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 exceed the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:
- (a)by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows;
- (b)for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and provided that that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place;
- (c)where there is a deficit of level 1 assets, additional level 2A assets may be held by the institution, subject to higher haircuts, and any cap applicable to those assets in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) may be amended.


**3.** The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants.


**4.** EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions set out in this Article.EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**5.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the derogations referred to in paragraph 2, including the conditions of their application.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 420

**Liquidity outflows**

*Article 420*


**1.** Pending the specification of a liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460, liquidity outflows to be reported shall include:
- (a)the current amount outstanding for retail deposits as set out in Article 421;
- (b)the current amounts outstanding of other liabilities that come due, can be called for payout by the issuing institutions or by the provider of the funding or entail an implicit expectation of the provider of the funding that the institution would repay the liability during the next 30 days as set out in Article 422;
- (c)the additional outflows referred to in Article 423;
- (d)the maximum amount that can be drawn during the next 30 days from undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities, as set out in Article 424;
- (e)the additional outflows identified in the assessment in accordance with paragraph 2.


**2.** Institutions shall regularly assess the likelihood and potential volume of liquidity outflows during the next 30 days as far as products or services are concerned, which are not captured in Articles 422, 423 and 424 and which they offer or sponsor or which potential purchasers would consider to be associated with them, including but not limited to liquidity outflows resulting from any contractual arrangements such as other off-balance sheet and contingent funding obligations, including, but not limited to committed funding facilities, un-drawn loans and advances to wholesale counterparties, mortgages that have been agreed but not yet drawn down, credit cards, overdrafts, planned outflows related to renewal or extension of new retail or wholesale loans, planned derivative payables and trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and in Annex I. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.For this assessment, institutions shall take particular account of material reputational damage that could result from not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Institutions shall report not less than annually to the competent authorities those products and services for which the likelihood and potential volume of the liquidity outflows referred to in the first subparagraph are material and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned. The competent authorities may apply an outflow rate up to 5 % for trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and Annex I.The competent authorities shall at least annually report to EBA the types of products or services for which they have determined outflows on the basis of the reports from institutions. They shall in that report also explain the methodology applied to determine the outflows.


# Article 421

**Outflows on retail deposits**

*Article 421*


**1.** Institutions shall separately report the amount of retail deposits covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country, and multiply by at least 5 % where the deposit is either of the following:
- (a)part of an established relationship making withdrawal highly unlikely;
- (b)held in a transactional account, including accounts to which salaries are regularly credited.


**2.** Institutions shall multiply other retail deposits not referred to in paragraph 1 by at least 10 %.


**3.** Taking into account the behaviour of local depositors as advised by competent authorities, EBA shall issue guidelines by 1 January 2014 on the criteria to determine the conditions of application of paragraphs 1 and 2 in relation to the identification of retail deposits subject to different outflows and the definitions of those products for purposes of this Title. Those guidelines shall take account of the likelihood of these deposits to lead to outflows of liquidity during the next 30 days. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.


**4.** Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage than provided for in those paragraphs if such percentage is provided by comparable third country reporting requirements.


**5.** Institutions may exclude from the calculation of outflows certain clearly circumscribed categories of retail deposits as long as in each and every instance the institution rigorously applies the following for the whole category of those deposits, unless in individually justified circumstances of hardship for the depositor:
- (a)within 30 days, the depositor is not allowed to withdraw the deposit; or
- (b)for early withdrawals within 30 days, the depositor has to pay a penalty that includes the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and the contractual maturity date plus a material penalty that does not have to exceed the interest due for the time elapsed between the date of deposit and the date of withdrawal.


# Article 422

**Outflows on other liabilities**

*Article 422*


**1.** Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from the institution's own operating expenses by 0 %.


**2.** Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 by:
- (a)0 % up to the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418 if they are collateralised by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416;
- (b)100 % over the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418, if they are collateralized by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416;
- (c)100 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416, with the exception of transactions covered by points (d) and (e) of this paragraph;
- (d)25 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 and the lender is the central government, a public sector entity of the Member State in which the credit institution has been authorised or has established a branch, or a multilateral development bank. Public sector entities that receive that treatment shall be limited to those that have a risk weight of 20 % or lower in accordance with Chapter 2, Title II of Part Three;
- (e)0 % if the lender is a central bank.


**3.** Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits that have to be maintained:
- (a)by the depositor in order to obtain clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services from the institution;
- (b)in the context of common task sharing within an institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7) or as a legal or statutory minimum deposit by another entity being a Member of the same institutional protection scheme;
- (c)by the depositor in the context of an established operational relationship other than that mentioned in point (a);
- (d)by the depositor to obtain cash clearing and central credit institution services and where the credit institution belongs to a network in accordance with legal or statutory provisions;by 5 % in the case of point (a) to the extent to which they are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country and by 25 % otherwise.Deposits from credit institutions placed at central credit institutions that are considered as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416(1)(f) shall be multiplied by 100 % outflow rate.


**4.** Clearing, custody, cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 shall only cover those services to the extent that those services are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependence. Those services shall not merely consist of correspondent banking or prime brokerage services, and institutions shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day time horizon without compromising its operational functioning.Pending a uniform definition of an established operational relationship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria for identifying an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day time horizon without compromising its operational functioning and shall report those criteria to the competent authorities. In the absence of a uniform definition, competent authorities may provide general guidance that institutions are to follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship.


**5.** Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits by clients that are not financial customers to the extent they do not fall under paragraphs 3 and 4 by 40 % and shall multiply the amount of these liabilities covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent Deposit Guarantee Scheme in a third country by 20 %.


**6.** Institutions shall take outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II into account on a net basis across counterparties and shall multiply them by 100 % in the case of a net outflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.


**7.** Institutions shall separately report other liabilities that do not fall under paragraphs 1 to 5.


**8.** Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower outflow percentage to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 7 on a case-by-case basis, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the counterparty is any of the following:(i)a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution, or a parent or subsidiary investment firm of the institution, or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or parent investment firm;(ii)the counterparty is linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;(iii)an institution falling within the same institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7); or(iv)the central institution or a member of a network compliant with point (d) of Article 400(2);
- (b)there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario;
- (c)a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Article 425;
- (d)the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.


**9.** Competent authorities may waive the conditions set out in point (d) of paragraph 8 where point (b) of Article 20(1) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such lower outflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in point (b) of Article 20(1). The fulfilment of the conditions for such lower outflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.


**10.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 9.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 423

**Additional outflows**

*Article 423*


**1.** Collateral other than assets referred to in Article 416(1)(a), (b) and (c), which is posted by the institution for contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, shall be subject to an additional outflow of 20 %.


**2.** An institution shall notify the competent authorities of all contracts entered into of which the contractual conditions lead to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs, within 30 days after a material deterioration of the institution's credit quality. Where the competent authorities consider those contracts to be material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts, which shall correspond to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in its credit quality, such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of that material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into, and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities.


**3.** The institution shall add an additional outflow which shall correspond to the collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on its derivatives transactions if material.EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions under which the notion of materiality may be applied and specifying methods for the measurement of the additional outflow.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**4.** The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to the market value of securities or other assets sold short and to be delivered within the 30 days horizon unless the institution owns the securities to be delivered or has borrowed them at terms requiring their return only after the 30 day horizon and the securities do not form part of the institutions liquid assets.


**5.** The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to:
- (a)the excess collateral the institution holds that can be contractually called at any time by the counterparty;
- (b)collateral that is due to be returned to a counterparty;
- (c)collateral that corresponds to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 that can be substituted for assets corresponding to assets that would not qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 without the consent of the institution.


**6.** Deposits received as collateral shall not be considered liabilities for the purposes of Article 422 but will be subject to the provisions of this Article where applicable.


# Article 424

**Outflows from credit and liquidity facilities**

*Article 424*


**1.** Institutions shall report outflows from committed credit facilities and committed liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn within the next 30 days. This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of any liquidity requirement that would be mandated under Article 420(2) for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of the value in accordance with Article 418 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral is held in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 416. The collateral to be provided shall not be assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities. If the necessary information is available to the institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn for credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn given the counterparty's own obligations or given the pre-defined contractual drawdown schedule coming due over the next 30 days.


**2.** The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 5 % if they qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk.


**3.** The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 10 % where they meet the following conditions:
- (a)they do not qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk;
- (b)they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers;
- (c)they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where he is unable to obtain its funding requirements in the financial markets.


**4.** The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling that SSPE to purchase assets, other than securities, from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 %, provided that the committed amount exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and that the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.


**5.** The institutions shall report the maximum amount that can be drawn of other undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days. This applies in particular to the following:
- (a)liquidity facilities that the institution has granted to SSPEs other than those referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3;
- (b)arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE;
- (c)facilities extended to credit institutions;
- (d)facilities extended to financial institutions and investment firms.


**6.** By way of derogation from paragraph 5, institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by at least one Member State's central or regional government may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those paragraphs. By way of derogation from point (g) of Article 425(2), where those promotional loans are extended via another institution as intermediary (pass through loans), a symmetric in and outflow may be applied by institutions. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union and/or that Member State's central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand linked to a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds disbursed.

*Article 425*


**1.** Institutions shall report their liquidity inflows. Liquidity inflows shall be capped at 75 % of liquidity outflows. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from deposits placed with other institutions that qualify for the treatment set out in Article 113(6) or (7) of this Regulation from that cap.Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from monies due from borrowers and bond investors where those inflows are related to mortgage lending funded by bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4), (5) or (6) of this Regulation or by covered bonds as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/2162 from that cap. Institutions may exempt inflows from promotional loans that the institutions have passed through. Subject to the prior approval of the competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis, the institution may fully or partially exempt inflows where the liquidity provider is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution, a parent or subsidiary investment firm of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or parent investment firm or is related to the institution as set out in Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU.


**2.** The liquidity inflows shall be measured over the next 30 days. They shall comprise only contractual inflows from exposures that are not past due and for which the institution has no reason to expect non-performance within the 30-day time horizon. Liquidity inflows shall be reported in full with the following inflows reported separately:
- (a)monies due from customers that are not financial customers for the purposes of principal payment shall be reduced by 50 % of their value or by the contractual commitments to those customers to extend funding, whichever is higher. This does not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 that are collateralised by liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 as referred to in point (d) of this paragraph.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this point, institutions that have received a commitment referred to in Article 424(6) in order for them to disburse a promotional loan to a final recipient may take an inflow into account up to the amount of the outflow they apply to the corresponding commitment to extend those promotional loans;
- (b)monies due from trade financing transactions referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 162(3) with a residual maturity of up to 30 days, shall be taken into account in full as inflows;
- (c)loans with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow, provided that the contract allows the institution to withdraw and request payment within 30 days;
- (d)monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 if they are collateralised by liquid assets as referred to in Article 416(1), shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due;
- (e)monies due that the institution owing those monies treats in accordance with Article 422(3) and (4), shall be multiplied by a corresponding symmetrical inflow;
- (f)monies due from positions in major index equity instruments provided that there is no double counting with liquid assets;
- (g)any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account.


**3.** Outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100 % in the event of a net inflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.


**4.** By way of derogation from point (g) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
- (a)there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under a combined market and idiosyncratic stress of the provider;
- (b)the counterparty is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU or a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation or the central institution or a member of a network that is subject to the waiver referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;
- (c)a corresponding symmetric or more conservative outflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Articles 422, 423 and 424;
- (d)the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.


**5.** Competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 4 where Article 20(1)(b) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such higher inflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in Article 20(1)(b). Fulfilment of the conditions for such higher inflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.


**6.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 5.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015.Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**7.** Institutions shall not report inflows from any of the liquid assets reported in accordance with Article 416 other than payments due on the assets that are not reflected in the market value of the asset.


**8.** Institutions shall not report inflows from any new obligations entered into.


**9.** Institutions shall take liquidity inflows which are to be received in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies into account only to the extent that they correspond to outflows respectively in the third country or currency in question.


# Article 426

**Updating Future liquidity requirements**

*Article 426*

Following, the adoption by the Commission of a delegated act to specify the liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460, EBA may develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the conditions set out in Article 421(1), Article 422, with the exception of paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of that Article, and Article 424 to take account of standards agreed internationally.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first paragraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

# Article 428a

**Application on a consolidated basis**

*Article 428A*

Where the net stable funding ratio set out in this Title applies on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(4), the following provisions shall apply:
- (a)the assets and off-balance-sheet items of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to required stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are higher than those specified in Chapter 4 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the higher factors specified in the national law of that third country;
- (b)the liabilities and own funds of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to available stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are lower than those specified in Chapter 3 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the lower factors specified in the national law of that third country;
- (c)third-country assets which meet the requirements laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and which are held by a subsidiary having its head office in a third country shall not be recognised as liquid assets for consolidation purposes where they do not qualify as liquid assets under the national law of that third country which sets out the liquidity coverage requirement.
- (d)investment firms that are not subject to this Title pursuant to Article 6(4) within the group shall be subject to Articles 413 and 428b on a consolidated basis; except as specified in this point, such investment firms shall remain subject to the detailed net stable funding requirement for investment firms as laid down in national law.
# Article 428b

**The net stable funding ratio**

*Article 428B*


**1.** The net stable funding requirement laid down in Article 413(1) shall be equal to the ratio of the institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 to the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4, and shall be expressed as a percentage. Institutions shall calculate their net stable funding ratio in accordance with the following formula:
$$
\frac{Available stable funding}{Required stable funding} = Net stable funding ratio 
\left(%\right)$$


**2.** Institutions shall maintain a net stable funding ratio of at least 100 %, calculated in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination.


**3.** Where, at any time, the net stable funding ratio of an institution has fallen below 100 %, or can be reasonably expected to fall below 100 %, the requirement laid down in Article 414 shall apply. The institution shall aim to restore its net stable funding ratio to the level referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. Competent authorities shall assess the reasons for the institution's failure to comply with paragraph 2 of this Article before taking any supervisory measures.


**4.** Institutions shall calculate and monitor their net stable funding ratio in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination, and separately for their transactions denominated in each of the currencies that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).


**5.** Institutions shall ensure that the distribution of their funding profile by currency denomination is generally consistent with the distribution of their assets by currency. Where appropriate, competent authorities may require institutions to restrict currency mismatches by setting limits on the proportion of required stable funding in a particular currency that can be met by available stable funding that is not denominated in that currency. That restriction may only be applied for a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).In determining the level of any restriction on currency mismatches that may be applied in accordance with this Article, competent authorities shall at least consider:
- (a)whether the institution has the ability to transfer available stable funding from one currency to another and across jurisdictions and legal entities within its group and the ability to swap currencies and raise funds in foreign currency markets over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;
- (b)the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on existing mismatched positions and on the effectiveness of any foreign currency exchange hedges that are in place.Any restriction on currency mismatches imposed in accordance with this Article shall constitute a specific liquidity requirement as referred to in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU.


# Article 428c

**Calculation of the net stable funding ratio**

*Article 428C*


**1.** Unless otherwise specified in this Title, institutions shall take into account assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items on a gross basis.


**2.** For the purpose of calculating their net stable funding ratio, institutions shall apply the appropriate stable funding factors set out in Chapters 3 and 4 to the accounting value of their assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, unless otherwise specified in this Title.


**3.** Institutions shall not double count required stable funding and available stable funding.Unless otherwise specified in this Title, where an item can be allocated to more than one required stable funding category, it shall be allocated to the required stable funding category that produces the greatest contractual required stable funding for that item.


# Article 428d

**Derivative contracts**

*Article 428D*


**1.** Institutions shall apply this Article to calculate the amount of required stable funding for derivative contracts as referred to in Chapters 3 and 4.


**2.** Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a net basis where those positions are included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1). Where that is not the case, institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a gross basis and shall treat those derivative positions as belonging to their own netting set for the purposes of Chapter 4.


**3.** For the purposes of this Title, the "fair value of a netting set" means the sum of the fair values of all the transactions included in a netting set.


**4.** Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), all derivative contracts listed in points 2(a) to (e) of Annex II that involve a full exchange of principal amounts on the same date shall be calculated on a net basis across currencies, including for the purpose of reporting in a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2), even where those transactions are not included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1).


**5.** Cash received as collateral to mitigate the exposure of a derivative position shall be treated as such and shall not be treated as deposits to which Chapter 3 applies.


**6.** Competent authorities may decide, with the approval of the relevant central bank, to waive the impact of derivative contracts on the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, including through the determination of the required stable funding factors and of provisions and losses, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)those contracts have a residual maturity of less than six months;
- (b)the counterparty is the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;
- (c)the derivative contracts serve the monetary policy of the ECB or the central bank of a Member State.Where a subsidiary having its head office in a third country benefits from the waiver referred to in the first subparagraph under the national law of that third country which sets out the net stable funding requirement, that waiver as specified in the national law of the third country shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.


# Article 428e

**Netting of secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions**

*Article 428E*

Assets and liabilities resulting from securities financing transactions with a single counterparty shall be calculated on a net basis, provided that those assets and liabilities comply with the netting conditions set out in Article 429b(4).
# Article 428f

**Interdependent assets and liabilities**

*Article 428F*


**1.** Subject to prior approval of the competent authorities, an institution may treat an asset and a liability as interdependent, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the institution acts solely as a pass-through unit to channel the funding from the liability into the corresponding interdependent asset;
- (b)the individual interdependent assets and liabilities are clearly identifiable and have the same principal amount;
- (c)the asset and interdependent liability have substantially matched maturities, with a maximum delay of 20 days between the maturity of the asset and the maturity of the liability;
- (d)the interdependent liability has been requested pursuant to a legal, regulatory or contractual commitment and is not used to fund other assets;
- (e)the principal payment flows from the asset are not used for other purposes than repaying the interdependent liability;
- (f)the counterparties for each pair of interdependent assets and liabilities are not the same.


**2.** Assets and liabilities shall be considered to meet the conditions set out in paragraph 1 and be considered as interdependent where they are directly linked to the following products or services:
- (a)centralised regulated savings, provided that institutions are legally required to transfer regulated deposits to a centralised fund which is set up and controlled by the central government of a Member State and which provides loans to promote public interest objectives, and provided that the transfer of deposits to the centralised fund occurs on at least a monthly basis;
- (b)promotional loans and credit and liquidity facilities that fulfil the criteria set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) for institutions acting as simple intermediaries that do not incur any funding risk;
- (c)covered bonds that meet all the following conditions:(i)they are bonds referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC or they meet the eligibility requirements for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) of this Regulation;(ii)the underlying loans are fully match funded with the covered bonds that were issued or the covered bonds have non-discretionary extendable maturity triggers of one year or more until the term of the underlying loans in the event of refinancing failure at the maturity date of the covered bond;
- (d)derivative client clearing activities, provided that the institution does not provide to its clients guarantees of the performance of the CCP and, as a result, does not incur any funding risk.


**3.** EBA shall monitor assets and liabilities, as well as products and services that are treated as interdependent assets and liabilities under paragraphs 1 and 2, to determine whether and to what extent the suitability criteria laid down in paragraph 1 are met. EBA shall report to the Commission on the results of that monitoring and shall advise the Commission on whether an amendment to the conditions set out in paragraph 1 or an amendment to the list of products and services in paragraph 2 would be necessary.


# Article 428g

**Deposits in institutional protection schemes and cooperative networks**

*Article 428G*

Where an institution belongs to an institutional protection scheme of the type referred to in Article 113(7), to a network that is eligible for the waiver provided for in Article 10, or to a cooperative network in a Member State, the sight deposits that the institution maintains with the central institution and that the depositing institution considers to be liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to the following:
- (a)the depositing institution shall apply the required stable funding factor under Section 2 of Chapter 4, depending on the treatment of those sight deposits as level 1, level 2A or level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and depending on the relevant haircut applied to those sight deposits for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio;
- (b)the central institution receiving the deposit shall apply the corresponding symmetric available stable funding factor.
# Article 428h

**Preferential treatment within a group or within an institutional protection scheme**

*Article 428H*


**1.** By way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, where Article 428g does not apply, competent authorities may authorise institutions on a case-by-case basis to apply a higher available stable funding factor or a lower required stable funding factor to assets, liabilities and committed credit or liquidity facilities, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the counterparty is one of the following:(i)the parent or a subsidiary of the institution;(ii)another subsidiary of the same parent;(iii)an undertaking that is related to the institution within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;(iv)a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation as the institution;(v)the central body or an affiliated credit institution of a network or a cooperative group as referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;
- (b)there are reasons to expect that the liability or committed credit or liquidity facility received by the institution constitutes a more stable source of funding, or that the asset or committed credit or liquidity facility granted by the institution requires less stable funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio than the same liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility received or granted by other counterparties;
- (c)the counterparty applies a required stable funding factor that is equal to or higher than the higher available stable funding factor or applies an available stable funding factor that is equal to or lower than the lower required stable funding factor;
- (d)the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.


**2.** Where the institution and the counterparty are established in different Member States, competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 1, provided that, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, the following criteria are met:
- (a)there are legally binding agreements and commitments between group entities regarding the liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility;
- (b)the funding provider presents a low funding risk profile;
- (c)the funding risk profile of the recipient of the funding has been adequately taken into account in the liquidity risk management of the funding provider.The competent authorities shall consult each other in accordance with point (b) of Article 20(1) to determine whether the additional criteria set out in this paragraph are met.


# Article 428i

**Calculation of the amount of available stable funding**

*Article 428I*

Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds.Bonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.
# Article 428j

**Residual maturity of a liability or of own funds**

*Article 428J*


**1.** Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.


**2.** Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.


**3.** Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits.


**4.** In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, institutions shall treat any portion of liabilities having a residual maturity of one year or more that matures in less than six months and any portion of such liabilities that matures between six months and less than one year as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.


# Article 428k

**0 % available stable funding factor**

*Article 428K*


**1.** Unless otherwise specified in Articles 428l to 428o, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor, with the exception of the following:

- (d)any other liabilities and capital items or instruments not referred to in Articles 428l to 428o.


**4.** Institutions shall apply a 0 % available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.The following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:
- (a)variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
- (b)all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.


# Article 428l

# Article 428p

**Calculation of the amount of required stable funding**

*Article 428P*


**1.** Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.


**2.** Assets which institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding where those assets are accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution and the institution does not have beneficial ownership of the asset.Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 where those assets are not accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution but the institution does have beneficial ownership of the assets.


**3.** Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions over which the institution retains beneficial ownership, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, even where the assets do not remain on the balance sheet of the institution. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.


**4.** Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.


**5.** Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that asset is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction in relation to which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered, provided that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.


**6.** The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:
- (a)assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded, credit lines that are available to the institution; those assets shall include assets placed by a credit institution with a central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme; institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer;
- (b)assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;
- (c)assets attached as non-mandatory overcollateralisation to a covered bond issuance.


**7.** In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:
- (a)by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 428ad and from point (a) of Article 428ah(1), assets encumbered for the purposes of the operations referred to in this subparagraph;
- (b)by way of derogation from points (d)(i) and (d)(ii) of Article 428ad, from point (b) of Article 428af and from point (c) of Article 428ag, monies that result from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets as referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and shall take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.


**8.** In order to avoid any double counting, institutions shall exclude assets that are associated with collateral that is recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and 428ah(2), recognised as initial margin posted, or recognised as a contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter.


**9.** Institutions shall include foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments. They shall exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.


**10.** Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.Competent authorities shall report the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors to EBA at least once a year. They shall include an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors in that report.


# Article 428q

**Residual maturity of an asset**

*Article 428Q*


**1.** Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.


**2.** Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.


**3.** When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.


**4.** In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.


# Article 428r

- (g)monies due from securities financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, where those monies due are collateralised by assets that qualify as level 1 assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified therein, and where the institution would be legally entitled and operationally able to reuse those assets for the duration of the transaction.Institutions shall take the monies due referred to in point (g) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph into account on a net basis where Article 428e applies.


**2.** By way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.For subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.

**1.** Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, for small and non-complex institutions the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.


**2.** Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are accounted for in their balance sheet and on which they do not have beneficial ownership shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are not accounted for in their balance sheet but on which they have beneficial ownership shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.


**3.** Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions, over which they retain beneficial ownership, even where they do not remain on their balance sheet, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.


**4.** Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.


**5.** Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction through which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered to the extent that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.


**6.** The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:
- (a)assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution, including assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme;
- (b)assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;
- (c)assets attached as non-mandatory over-collateralisation to a covered bond issuance.For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer.


**7.** In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:
- (a)by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (a) of Article 428az(1), assets encumbered for the operations referred to in this subparagraph;
- (b)by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (b) of Article 428ay, monies resulting from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.


**8.** Institutions shall exclude assets associated with collateral recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and Article 428ah(2) or as initial margin posted or as contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter in order to avoid any double counting.


**9.** Institutions shall include in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed. They shall exclude from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.


**10.** Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.Competent authorities shall report to EBA the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors at least once a year. They shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors.


# Article 428ar

**Residual maturity of an asset**

*Article 428AR*


**1.** Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.


**2.** Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.


**3.** When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.


**4.** In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, the portions that mature in less than six months and between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively.


# Article 428as

**0 % required stable funding factor**

*Article 428AS*


**1.** The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:

- (c)all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country that have a residual maturity of less than six months;
- (d)assets that are categorised as being interdependent with liabilities in accordance with Article 428f.


**2.** By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.For subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.


# Article 428at

**5 % required stable funding factor**

*Article 428AT*


**1.** The undrawn portion of committed credit and liquidity facilities specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 5 % required stable funding factor.


**2.** For all netting sets of derivative contracts, institutions shall apply a 5 % required stable funding factor to the absolute fair value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative fair value. For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the fair value as gross of any collateral posted or settlement payments and receipts related to market valuation changes of such contracts.

- (a)variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
- (b)all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.


# Article 429

**Calculation of the leverage ratio**

*Article 429*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate their leverage ratio in accordance with the methodology set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.


**2.** The leverage ratio shall be calculated as an institution's capital measure divided by that institution's total exposure measure and shall be expressed as a percentage.Institutions shall calculate the leverage ratio at the reporting reference date.


**3.** For the purposes of paragraph 2, the capital measure shall be the Tier 1 capital.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraph 2, the total exposure measure shall be the sum of the exposure values of:
- (a)assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e, calculated in accordance with Article 429b(1);
- (b)derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, including those contracts and credit derivatives that are off-balance-sheet, calculated in accordance with Articles 429c and 429d;
- (c)add-ons for counterparty credit risk of securities financing transactions, including those that are off-balance-sheet, calculated in accordance with Article 429e;
- (d)off-balance-sheet items, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, securities financing transactions and positions referred to in Articles 429d and 429g, calculated in accordance with Article 429f;
- (e)regular-way purchases or sales awaiting settlement, calculated in accordance with Article 429g.Institutions shall treat long settlement transactions in accordance with points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph, as applicable.Institutions may reduce the exposure values referred to in points (a) and (d) of the first subparagraph by the corresponding amount of general credit risk adjustments to on- and off-balance-sheet items, respectively, subject to a floor of 0 where the credit risk adjustments have reduced the Tier 1 capital.


**5.** By way of derogation from point (d) of paragraph 4, the following provisions shall apply:
- (a)an off-balance-sheet item in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 4 that is treated as a derivative in accordance with the applicable accounting framework shall be subject to the treatment set out in point (b) of that paragraph;
- (b)where a client of an institution acting as a clearing member enters directly into a derivative transaction with a CCP and the institution guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures to the CCP arising from that transaction, the institution shall calculate its exposure resulting from the guarantee in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 4, as if that institution had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to the receipt or provision of cash variation margin.The treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall also apply to an institution acting as a higher-level client that guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures.For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (b), and of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions may consider an affiliated entity as a client only where that entity is outside the regulatory scope of consolidation at the level at which the requirement set out in Article 92(4), point (e), is applied.


**6.** For the purposes of paragraph 4, point (e), of this Article and Article 429g, "regular-way purchase or sale" means a purchase or a sale of a financial asset under contracts for which the terms require delivery of the financial asset within the period established generally by law or convention in the marketplace concerned.

- (a)physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce the total exposure measure;
- (b)assets shall not be netted with liabilities.


**8.** By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 7, institutions may reduce the exposure value of a pre-financing loan or an intermediate loan by the positive balance on the savings account of the debtor to which the loan was granted and only include the resulting amount in the total exposure measure, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the granting of the loan is conditional upon the opening of the savings account at the institution granting the loan and both the loan and the savings account are regulated by the same sectoral law;
- (b)the balance on the savings account cannot be withdrawn, in part or in full, by the debtor for the entire duration of the loan;
- (c)the institution can unconditionally and irrevocably use the balance on the savings account to settle any claim originating under the loan agreement in cases regulated by the sectoral law referred to in point (a), including the case of non-payment by or the insolvency of the debtor."Pre-financing loan" or "intermediate loan" means a loan that is granted to the borrower for a limited period of time in order to bridge the borrower's financing gaps until the final loan is granted in accordance with the criteria laid down in the sectoral law regulating such transactions.

**1.** Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e in accordance with the following principles:
- (a)the exposure values of assets means an exposure value as referred to in the first sentence of Article 111(1);
- (b)securities financing transactions shall not be netted.


**2.** A cash pooling arrangement offered by an institution does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7) only where the arrangement meets both of the following conditions:
- (a)the institution offering the cash pooling arrangement transfers the credit and debit balances of several individual accounts of entities of a group included in the arrangement ("original accounts") into a separate, single account and thereby sets the balances of the original accounts to zero;
- (b)the institution carries out the actions referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph on a daily basis.For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 3, cash pooling arrangement means an arrangement whereby the credit or debit balances of several individual accounts are combined for the purposes of cash or liquidity management.


**3.** By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, a cash pooling arrangement that does not meet the condition set out in point (b) of that paragraph, but meets the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph, does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7), provided that the arrangement meets all the following conditions:

- (b)there are no maturity mismatches between the balances of the original accounts;
- (c)the institution charges or pays interest based on the combined balance of the original accounts;
- (d)the competent authority of the institution considers that the frequency by which the balances of all original accounts are transferred is adequate for the purpose of including only the combined balance of the cash pooling arrangement in the total exposure measure.


**4.** By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate the exposure value of cash receivable and cash payable under securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis only where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;

- (c)the counterparties intend to settle on a net basis or to settle simultaneously, or the transactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net settlement.


**5.** For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 4, institutions may consider that a settlement mechanism results in the functional equivalent of net settlement only where, on the settlement date, the net result of the cash flows of the transactions under that mechanism is equal to the single net amount under net settlement and all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the transactions are settled through the same settlement system or settlement systems using a common settlement infrastructure;
- (b)the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that the settlement of the transactions will occur by the end of the business day;
- (c)any issues arising from the securities legs of the securities financing transactions do not interfere with the completion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and payables.The condition set out in point (c) of the first subparagraph is met only where the failure of any securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism may delay settlement of only the matching cash leg or may create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility.Where there is a failure of the securities leg of a securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement mechanism, institutions shall split out this transaction and its matching cash leg from the netting set and treat them on a gross basis.


# Article 429c

**Calculation of the exposure value of derivatives**

*Article 429C*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, including those that are off-balance-sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three.When calculating the exposure value, institutions may take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements in accordance with Article 295. Institutions shall not take into account cross-product netting, but may net within the product category as referred to in point (25)(c) of Article 272 and credit derivatives where they are subject to a contractual cross-product netting agreement as referred to in point (c) of Article 295.Institutions shall include in the total exposure measure sold options even where their exposure value can be set to zero in accordance with the treatment laid down in Article 274(5).


**2.** Where the provision of collateral related to derivative contracts reduces the amount of assets under the applicable accounting framework, institutions shall reverse that reduction.


**3.** For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions calculating the replacement cost of derivative contracts in accordance with Article 275 may recognise only collateral received in cash from their counterparties as the variation margin referred to in Article 275, where the applicable accounting framework has not already recognised the variation margin as a reduction of the exposure value and where all the following conditions are met:
- (a)for trades not cleared through a QCCP, the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated from the assets of the institution;
- (b)the variation margin is calculated and exchanged at least daily based on a mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions;
- (c)the variation margin received is in a currency specified in the derivative contract, governing master netting agreement, credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement or as defined by any netting agreement with a QCCP;
- (d)the variation margin received is the full amount that would be necessary to extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative contract subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts that are applicable to the counterparty;
- (e)the derivative contract and the variation margin between the institution and the counterparty to that contract are covered by a single netting agreement that the institution may treat as risk-reducing in accordance with Article 295.Where an institution provides cash collateral to a counterparty and that collateral meets the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) of the first subparagraph, the institution shall consider that collateral as the variation margin posted with the counterparty and shall include it in the calculation of the replacement cost.For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, an institution shall be considered to have met the condition set out therein where the variation margin is exchanged on the morning of the trading day following the trading day on which the derivative contract was stipulated, provided that the exchange is based on the value of the contract at the end of the trading day on which the contract was stipulated.For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, where a margin dispute arises, institutions may recognise the amount of non-disputed collateral that has been exchanged.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall not include collateral received in the calculation of NICA as defined in Article 272, point (12a).


**4a.** By way of derogation from paragraphs 3 and 4, an institution may recognise any collateral received in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 3 where all of the following conditions are met:
- (a)the collateral is received from a client for a derivative contract cleared by the institution on behalf of that client;
- (b)the contract referred to in point (a) is cleared through a QCCP;
- (c)where the collateral has been received in the form of initial margin, that collateral is segregated from the assets of the institution.


**5.** For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall set the value of the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 278(1) to one, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.


**6.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 4 or 5 to determine the exposure value of the following:
- (a)derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purposes of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92(1), points (a), (b) and (c);
- (b)credit derivatives to which they apply the treatment set out in Article 273(3) or (5), where the conditions to use that method are met.Where institutions apply one of the methods referred to in the first subparagraph, they shall not reduce the total exposure measure by the amount of margin they have received.


# Article 429d

**Additional provisions on the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives**

*Article 429D*


**1.** For the purposes of this Article, "written credit derivative" means any financial instrument through which an institution effectively provides credit protection including credit default swaps, total return swaps and options where the institution has the obligation to provide credit protection under conditions specified in the options contract.


**2.** In addition to the calculation laid down in Article 429c, institutions shall include in the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives the effective notional amounts referenced in the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to those written credit derivatives.Institutions shall calculate the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives by adjusting the notional amount of those derivatives to reflect the true exposure of the contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction.


**3.** Institutions may fully or partly reduce the exposure value calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives, provided that all the following conditions are met:
- (a)the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;
- (b)the purchased credit derivative is otherwise subject to the same or more conservative material terms as those in the corresponding written credit derivative;
- (c)the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty that would expose the institution to Specific Wrong-Way risk, as defined in point (b) of Article 291(1);
- (d)where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is reduced by any negative change in fair value incorporated in the institution's Tier 1 capital, the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital;
- (e)the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction that has been cleared by the institution on behalf of a client or that has been cleared by the institution in its role as a higher-level client in a multi-level client structure and for which the effective notional amount referenced by the corresponding written credit derivative is excluded from the total exposure measure in accordance with point (g) or (h) of the first subparagraph of Article 429a(1), as applicable.For the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 429c(1), institutions may exclude from the netting set the portion of a written credit derivative which is not offset in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for which the effective notional amount is included in the total exposure measure.


**4.** For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 3, "material term" means any characteristic of the credit derivative that is relevant to the valuation thereof, including the level of subordination, the optionality, the credit events, the underlying reference entity or pool of entities, and the underlying reference obligation or pool of obligations, with the exception of the notional amount and the residual maturity of the credit derivative. Two reference names shall be the same only where they refer to the same legal entity.


**5.** By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 3, institutions may use purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference names to offset written credit derivatives on individual reference names within that pool where the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are the same.


**6.** Institutions shall not reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative in Tier 1 capital.


**7.** In the case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference obligations, institutions may reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives on individual reference obligations by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives in accordance with paragraph 3 only where the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual obligations in the pool.


# Article 429e

**Counterparty credit risk add-on for securities financing transactions**

*Article 429E*


**1.** In addition to the calculation of the exposure value of securities financing transactions, including those that are off-balance-sheet in accordance with Article 429b(1), institutions shall include in the total exposure measure an add-on for counterparty credit risk calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article, as applicable.


**2.** Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are not subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on a transaction-by-transaction basis in accordance with the following formula:
$$E
^{*}
_{i} = \max
(0, E
_{i} - C
_{i})$$
where:
- **
$$E
^{*}
_{i}$$
**=the add-on;
- **i**=the index that denotes the transaction;
- **Ei**=the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty under transaction i; and
- **Ci**=the fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty under transaction i.Institutions may set 
$$E
^{*}
_{i}$$
 equal to zero where Ei is the cash lent to a counterparty and the associated cash receivable is not eligible for the netting treatment set out in Article 429b(4).


**3.** Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on an agreement-by-agreement basis in accordance with the following formula:
$$E
^{*}
_{i} = \max
(0, 
\sum
_{i} E
_{i} - 
\sum
_{i} C
_{i})$$
where:
- **
$$E
^{*}
_{i}$$
**=the add-on;
- **i**=the index that denotes the netting agreement;
- **Ei**=the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty for the transactions that are subject to master netting agreement i; and
- **Ci**=the fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty that is subject to master netting agreement i.


**4.** For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the term counterparty includes also tri-party agents that receive collateral in deposit and manage the collateral in the case of tri-party transactions.


**5.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Article 222, subject to a 20 % floor for the applicable risk weight, to determine the add-on for securities financing transactions including those that are off-balance-sheet. Institutions may use that method only where they also use it for calculating the exposure value of those transactions for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements as set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 92(1).


**6.** Where sale accounting is achieved for a repurchase transaction under the applicable accounting framework, the institution shall reverse all sales-related accounting entries.


**7.** Where an institution acts as an agent between two parties in a securities financing transaction, including an off-balance-sheet transaction, the following provisions shall apply to the calculation of the institution's total exposure measure:
- (a)where the institution provides an indemnity or guarantee to one of the parties in the securities financing transaction and the indemnity or guarantee is limited to any difference between the value of the security or cash the party has lent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, the institution shall only include the add-on calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, in the total exposure measure;
- (b)where the institution does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the transaction shall not be included in the total exposure measure;
- (c)where the institution is economically exposed to the underlying security or the cash in the transaction to an amount greater than the exposure covered by the add-on, it shall include in the total exposure measure also the full amount of the security or the cash to which it is exposed;
- (d)where the institution acting as agent provides an indemnity or guarantee to both parties involved in a securities financing transaction, the institution shall calculate its total exposure measure in accordance with points (a), (b) and (c) separately for each party involved in the transaction.


# Article 429f

**Calculation of the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items**

*Article 429F*


**1.** Institutions shall calculate, in accordance with Article 111(2), the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items, excluding the derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, securities financing transactions and the positions referred to in Article 429d.Where a commitment refers to the extension of another off-balance-sheet item, Article 111(3) shall apply.


**2.** By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions may reduce the credit exposure equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet item by the corresponding amount of specific credit risk adjustments. The calculation shall be subject to a floor of zero.


**3.** By way of derogation from Article 495d, institutions shall apply a conversion factor of 10 % to off-balance-sheet items in the form of unconditionally cancellable commitments.


# Article 429g

**Calculation of the exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement**

*Article 429G*


**1.** Institutions shall treat cash related to regular-way purchases and financial assets related to regular-way sales which remain on the balance sheet until the settlement date as assets in accordance with Article 429(4), point (a).


**2.** Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply trade date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall reverse out any offsetting between cash receivables for regular-way sales awaiting settlement and cash payables for regular-way purchase awaiting settlement allowed under that framework. After institutions have reversed out the accounting offsetting, they may offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where both the related regular-way sales and purchases are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis.


**3.** Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply settlement date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall include in the total exposure measure the full nominal value of commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases.Institutions may offset the full nominal value of the commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases by the full nominal value of cash receivables related to regular-way sales awaiting settlement only where both of the following conditions are met:
- (a)both the regular-way purchases and sales are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis;
- (b)the financial assets bought and sold that are associated with cash payables and receivables are fair valued through profit and loss and included in the institution's trading book.

# Article 458

**Macroprudential or systemic risk identified at the level of a Member State**

*Article 458*


**1.** Member States shall designate the authority in charge of the application of this Article. This authority shall be the competent authority or the designated authority.


**2.** Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article identifies changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State and which that authority considers that cannot be addressed by means of other macroprudential tools set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU as effectively as by implementing stricter national measures, it shall notify the Commission and the ESRB accordingly. The ESRB shall forward the notification to the European Parliament, to the Council and to EBA without delay.The notification shall be accompanied by the following documents and include, where appropriate, relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence on:
- (a)the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk;
- (b)the reasons why such changes could pose a threat to financial stability at national level or to the real economy;
- (c)an explanation as to why the authority considers that the macroprudential tools set out in Articles 124 and 164 of this Regulation and Articles 133 and 136 of Directive 2013/36/EU would be less suitable and effective to deal with those risks than the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of this paragraph;
- (d)the draft national measures for domestically authorised institutions, or a subset of those institutions, intended to mitigate the changes in the intensity of risk and concerning:(i)the level of own funds laid down in Article 92;(ii)the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403;(iii)liquidity requirements laid down in Part Six;(iv)risk weights for targeting asset bubbles in the residential property and commercial immovable property sector;(v)the public disclosure requirements laid down in Part Eight;(vi)the level of the capital conservation buffer laid down in Article 129 of Directive 2013/36/EU; or(vii)intra-financial sector exposures;
- (e)an explanation as to why the draft measures are considered by the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1 to be suitable, effective and proportionate to address the situation; and
- (f)an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the draft measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State concerned.


**3.** When authorised to apply national measures in accordance with this Article, the authorities determined in accordance with paragraph 1 shall provide relevant competent authorities or designated authorities in other Member States with all relevant information.


**4.** The power to adopt an implementing act to reject the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of paragraph 2 is conferred on the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission.Within one month of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the ESRB and EBA shall provide their opinions on the matters referred to in points (a) to (f) of that paragraph to the Council, to the Commission and to the Member State concerned.Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.The Council shall decide on the proposal by the Commission within one month after receipt of the proposal and state its reasons for rejecting or not rejecting the draft national measures.The Council shall only reject the draft national measures if it considers that one or more of the following conditions are not met:
- (a)the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk are of such nature as to pose risk to financial stability at national level;
- (b)the macroprudential tools set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are less suitable or effective than the draft national measures to deal with the macroprudential or systemic risk identified;
- (c)the draft national measures do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market; and
- (d)the issue concerns only one Member State.The assessment of the Council shall take into account the opinion of the ESRB and EBA and shall be based on the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 2 by the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1.In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month of receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State concerned may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.


**5.** Other Member States may recognise the measures adopted in accordance with this Article and apply them to domestically authorised institutions, which have branches or have exposures located in the Member State authorised to apply the measure.


**6.** Where Member States recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, they shall notify the ESRB. The ESRB shall forward such notifications without delay to the Council, the Commission, EBA and the Member State authorised to apply the measures.


**7.** When deciding whether to recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, the Member State shall take into consideration the criteria set in paragraph 4.


**8.** The Member State authorised to apply the measures may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more Member States which do not recognise the measures.


**9.** Before the expiry of the authorisation issued in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4, the Member State concerned shall, in consultation with the ESRB, EBA and the Commission, review the situation and may adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4, a new decision for the extension of the period of application of national measures for up to two additional years each time.


**10.** Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9 of this Article, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided for in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (d)(iv) and (d)(vii) of paragraph 2 of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided for in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article are met.

**Transitional provisions on the prudential treatment of crypto-assets**

*Article 501D*


**1.** By 30 June 2025, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council to introduce a dedicated prudential treatment for crypto-asset exposures, taking into account the international standards and Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. That legislative proposal shall include the following:
- (a)criteria for assigning crypto-assets to different crypto-asset categories based on their risk characteristics and compliance with specific conditions;
- (b)specific own funds requirements for all risks entailed by different crypto-assets;
- (c)an aggregate limit for exposures to specific types of crypto-assets;
- (d)specific leverage ratio requirements for crypto-asset exposures;
- (e)specific supervisory powers as regards crypto-asset exposure assignment, monitoring and calculation of the own funds requirements;
- (f)specific liquidity requirements for crypto-asset exposures;
- (g)disclosure and reporting requirements.


**2.** Until the date of application of the legislative act referred to in paragraph 1, institutions shall calculate their own funds requirements for crypto-asset exposures as follows:
- (a)crypto-asset exposures to tokenised traditional assets shall be treated as exposures to the traditional assets that they represent;
- (b)exposures to asset-referenced tokens whose issuers comply with Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and that reference one or more traditional assets shall be assigned a risk weight of 250 %;
- (c)crypto-asset exposures other than those referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be assigned a risk weight of 1 250 %.By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, point (a), crypto-asset exposures to tokenised traditional assets whose values depend on any other crypto-assets shall be assigned to point (c).


**3.** The value of an institution’s total exposure to crypto-assets other than those referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), shall not exceed 1 % of the institution’s Tier 1 capital.


**4.** An institution that exceeds the limit set out in paragraph 3 shall immediately notify the competent authority of the breach and shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority a timely return to compliance.


**5.** EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical elements necessary for institutions to calculate their own funds requirements in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraph 2, points (b) and (c), including how to calculate the value of the exposures and how to aggregate short and long exposures for the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3.In developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into consideration the related internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS as well as existing authorisations in the Union under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


**6.** For the calculation of their own funds requirements for crypto-asset exposures, institutions shall not apply the deduction referred to in Article 36(1), point (b).


# Article 502

**Cyclicality of capital requirements**

*Article 502*

The Commission, in cooperation with EBA, ESRB and the Member States, and taking into account the opinion of the ECB, shall periodically monitor whether this Regulation taken as a whole, together with Directive 2013/36/EU, has significant effects on the economic cycle and, in the light of that examination, shall consider whether any remedial measures are justified.By 31 December 2013, EBA shall report to the Commission on whether, and if so how, methodologies of institutions under the IRB Approach should converge with a view to more comparable capital requirements while mitigating pro-cyclicality.Based on that analysis and taking into account the opinion of the ECB, the Commission shall draw up a biennial report and submit it to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate proposals. Contributions from credit taking and credit lending parties shall be adequately acknowledged when the report is drawn up.By 31 December 2014, the Commission shall review, and report on, the application of Article 33(1)(c) and shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate.With respect to the potential deletion of Article 33(1)(c) and its potential application at the Union level, the review shall in particular ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to ensure financial stability in all Member States.
# Article 503

**Own funds requirements for exposures in the form of covered bonds**

*Article 503*


**1.** The Commission shall, by 31 December 2014, after consulting EBA, report to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate proposals, on whether the risk weights laid down in Article 129 and the own funds requirements for specific risk in Article 336(3) are adequate for all the instruments that qualify for these treatments and whether the criteria in Article 129 are appropriate.


**2.** The report and the proposals referred to in paragraph 1 shall take into account:
- (a)the extent to which the current regulatory capital requirements applicable to covered bonds adequately differentiate between variances in the credit quality of covered bonds and the collateral against which they are secured, including the extent of variations across Member States;
- (b)the transparency of the covered bond market and the extent to which this facilitates comprehensive internal analysis by investors in respect of the credit risk of covered bonds and the collateral against which they are secured and the asset segregation in case of the issuer's insolvency, including the mitigating effects of the underlying strict national legal framework in accordance with Article 129 of this Regulation and Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC on the overall credit quality of a covered bond and its implications on the level of transparency needed by investors; and
- (c)the extent to which covered bond issuance by a credit institution impacts on the credit risk to which other creditors of the issuing institution are exposed.


**3.** The Commission shall, by 31 December 2014, after consulting EBA, report to the European Parliament and the Council on whether loans secured by aircrafts (aircraft liens) and residential loans secured by a guarantee but not secured by a registered mortgage, should under certain conditions be considered an eligible asset in accordance with Article 129.


**4.** The Commission shall, by 31 December 2016, review the appropriateness of the derogation set out in Article 496 and, if relevant, the appropriateness of extending similar treatment to any other form of covered bond. In the light of that review, the Commission may, if appropriate, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 462 to make that derogation permanent, or make legislative proposals to extend it to other forms of covered bonds.

*Article 506A*

In close cooperation with the ESRB and EBA, the Commission shall publish a report by 31 December 2021 in which it shall assess whether changes to the regulatory framework are needed to promote the market for, and bank purchases of, exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs with an underlying portfolio consisting exclusively of sovereign bonds of Member States whose currency is the euro, where the relative weight of each Member States’ sovereign bonds in the total portfolio of the CIU is equal to the relative weight of each Member States’ capital contribution to the ECB.
# Article 506b

**NPE securitisations**

*Article 506B*


**1.** EBA shall monitor the application of Article 269a and shall evaluate the regulatory capital treatment of NPE securitisations having regard to the state of the market for NPEs in general and the state of NPE securitisation market in particular, and submit a report on its findings to the Commission by 10 October 2022.


**2.** By 10 April 2023, the Commission shall, on the basis of the report referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of Article 269a.

# Article 506d

**Prudential treatment of securitisation**

*Article 506D*


**1.** By 31 December 2026, EBA, in close collaboration with ESMA, shall report to the Commission on the prudential treatment of securitisation transactions, differentiating between different types of securitisations, including synthetic securitisations, between originators and investors, and between STS and non-STS transactions.


**2.** In particular, EBA shall monitor the use of the transitional arrangement referred to in Article 465(13) and assess the extent to which the application of the output floor to securitisation exposures would affect the capital reduction obtained by originator institutions in transactions for which a significant risk transfer has been recognised, would excessively reduce the risk sensitivity and would affect the economic viability of new securitisation transactions. In such cases of a reduction of risk sensitivities, EBA may consider proposing a downward recalibration of the non-neutrality factors for transactions for which a significant risk transfer has been recognised. EBA shall also assess the appropriateness of the non-neutrality factors under both the SEC-SA and the SEC-IRBA, taking into account the historic credit performance of securitisation transactions in the Union and the reduced model and agency risks of the securitisation framework.


**3.** On the basis of the report referred to in paragraph 1 and taking into account related internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal by 31 December 2027.

That report shall assess, in particular, for each exemption provided for in those Articles:
- (a)the number of large exposures exempted in each Member State;
- (b)the number of institutions that make use of the exemption in each Member State;
- (c)the aggregate amount of exposures exempted in each Member State.

- (a)the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its application, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing;
- (b)the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2);
- (c)the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account international regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
- (d)the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State;
- (e)the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %;
- (f)the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons;
- (g)the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments;
- (h)derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject;
- (i)the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah-compliant banks;
- (j)the definition of circumstances of stress, including principles for the use of the stock of liquid assets and the necessary supervisory reactions under which institutions would be able to use their liquid assets to meet liquidity outflows and how to address non-compliance;
- (k)the definition of an established operational relationship for non-financial customer as referred to in Article 422(3)(c);
- (l)the calibration of the outflow rate applicable to correspondent banking and prime brokerage services as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 422(4);
- (m)mechanisms for the grandfathering of government guaranteed bonds issued to credit institutions as part of government support measures with Union State aid approval, such as bonds issued by the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in Ireland and by the Spanish Asset Management Company in Spain, designed to remove problem assets from the balance sheets of credit institutions, as assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality until at least December 2023.


**3.** EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1).The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on that report.The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall also consider:

- (a)minimum trade volume of the assets;
- (b)minimum outstanding volume of the assets;
- (c)transparent pricing and post-trade information;
- (d)credit quality steps referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;

- (a)uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality;
- (b)the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which:(i)a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise institutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations;(ii)regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions from lending or borrowing on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation;(iii)the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments;
- (c)the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article 417, in line with international regulatory developments.

**4.** EBA shall monitor the amount of required stable funding covering the funding risk linked to the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio, in particular the future funding risk for those derivative contracts set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2), and report to the Commission on the opportunity to adopt a higher required stable funding factor or a more risk-sensitive measure by 28 June 2024. That report shall at least assess:
- (a)the opportunity to distinguish between margined and unmargined derivative contracts;
- (b)the opportunity to remove, increase or replace the requirement set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2);
- (c)the opportunity to change more broadly the treatment of derivative contracts in the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, as set out in Article 428d, Articles 428k(4) and 428s(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag, Articles 428ah(2), 428al(4) and 428at(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ay and Article 428az(2), to better capture the funding risk linked to those contracts over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;
- (d)the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for institutions' derivative contracts.


**5.** If international standards affect the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 4, those changes of international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


**6.** EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including to the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers and report to the Commission on the appropriateness of that treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:
- (a)the opportunity to apply higher or lower stable funding factors to securities financing transactions with financial customers and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers to take better account of their funding risk over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio and of the possible contagion effects between financial customers;
- (b)the opportunity to apply the treatment set out in point (g) of Article 428r(1) to securities financing transactions collateralised by other types of assets;
- (c)the opportunity to apply stable funding factors to off-balance-sheet items used in securities financing transactions as an alternative to the treatment set out in Article 428p(5);
- (d)the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with point (c) of Article 428k(3) and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and point (b) of Article 428v;
- (e)the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers, on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds;
- (f)the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for those institutions' transactions, in particular for securities financing transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers where sovereign bonds are received as collateral in those transactions.


**7.** By 28 June 2024, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 6, any international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of securities financing transactions, including of the assets received or given in those transactions, and the treatment of unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


**8.** By 28 June 2025, the required stable funding factors applied to the transactions referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (b) of Article 428s(1) and in point (a) of Article 428v, shall be raised from 0 % to 10 %, from 5 % to 15 % and from 10 % to 15 % respectively, unless otherwise specified in a legislative act adopted on the basis of a proposal by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article.


**9.** EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts. EBA shall report on the appropriateness of the treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:
- (a)the possible impact of the treatment on investors' ability to gain exposure to assets and the impact of the treatment on credit supply in the capital markets union;
- (b)the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are funded by initial margin, either wholly or in part;
- (c)the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin.


**10.** By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.


**11.** EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less. EBA shall submit its report to the Commission by 28 June 2021.

- (a)whether the current macroprudential tools in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and transparent;
- (b)whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap between different macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are adequate and, if appropriate, propose new macroprudential rules;
- (c)how internationally agreed standards for systemic institutions interact with the provisions in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU and, if appropriate, propose new rules taking into account those internationally agreed standards;
- (d)whether other types of instruments, such as borrower-based instruments, should be added to the macroprudential tools provided for in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU to complement capital-based instruments and to allow for the harmonised use of the instruments in the internal market; taking into account whether harmonised definitions of those instruments and the reporting of respective data at Union level are a prerequisite for the introduction of such instruments;
- (e)whether the leverage ratio buffer requirement as referred to in Article 92(1a) should be extended to systemically important institutions other than G-SIIs, whether its calibration should be different from the calibration for G-SIIs, and whether its calibration should depend on the level of systemic importance of the institution;
- (f)whether the current voluntary reciprocity of macroprudnetial measures should be turned into mandatory reciprocity and whether the current ESRB framework for voluntary reciprocity is an appropriate basis for that;
- (g)how relevant Union and national macroprudential authorities can be mandated with tools to address new emerging systemic risks arising from credit institutions exposures to the non-banking sector, in particular from derivatives and securities financing transactions markets, the asset management sector and the insurance sector.

- (a)the degree of leverage outside the banking system in the Union and the extent to which the minimum haircut floor framework could reduce that leverage if it became excessive;
- (b)the materiality of the securities financing transactions held by institutions in the Union that are subject to the minimum haircut floor framework, including the breakdown of those securities financing transactions which do not comply with the minimum haircut floors;
- (c)the estimated impact of the minimum haircut floor framework for institutions in the Union under the two implementation approaches recommended by the Financial Stability Board, namely a market regulation or more punitive own funds requirement under this Regulation, under a scenario in which institutions in the Union would not adjust haircuts to their securities financing transactions to comply with minimum haircut floors, and the estimated impact of the minimum haircut floor framework under an alternative scenario in which institutions in the Union would adjust those haircuts to comply with minimum haircut floors;

- (i)for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the mark-to-market method laid down in Article 274 thereof;
- (ii)for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation. The exception set out in point (a) of Article 285(3) of that Regulation, shall not apply;
- (iii)for exposures arising from transactions not listed in Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which entails settlement risk only it shall calculate them in accordance with Part Three, Title V of that Regulation;
- (b)for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in Part Three, Title II of that Regulation;
- (c)when calculating the values referred to in point (a), the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
- (e)where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP;
- (f)where a CCP has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the CCP shall consider that initial margin as prefunded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;
- (h)when applying the Mark-to-Market Method as set out in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall replace the formula in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of that Regulation with the following:
$$PCE
_{red} = 0.15  \times  PCE
_{gross} + 0.85  \times  NGR  \times  PCE
_{gross}$$
where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of that Regulation and just before the variation margin is actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is gross replacement cost;
- (i)where a CCP cannot calculate the value of NGR as set out in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it shall:
- (i)notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities about its inability to calculate NGR and the reasons why it is unable to carry out the calculation;

- (j)where, at the end of the period specified in point (ii) of point (i), the CCP would still be unable to calculate the value of NGR, it shall do the following:
- (i)stop calculating KCCP;
- (ii)notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities that it has stopped calculating KCCP;
- (k)for the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure for options and swaptions in accordance with the Mark-to-Market Method specified in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall multiply the notional amount of the contract by the absolute value of the option's delta
$$
\left(δV  /  δp\right)$$

# Article 50d

**Calculation of specific items to be reported by the CCP**

*Article 050D*

For the purposes of Article 50c, the following shall apply:
- (a)where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources in parallel to the pre-funded contributions of its clearing members in a manner that makes those resources equivalent to pre-funded contributions of a clearing member in terms of how they absorb the losses incurred by the CCP in the case of the default or insolvency of one or more of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those resources to DFCM;
- (b)where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources to cover its losses due to the default of one or more of its clearing members after it has depleted its default fund, but before it calls on the contractually committed contributions of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those additional financial resources 
$$
\left(DF
_{CCP}
^{a}\right)$$
to the total amount of pre-funded contributions (DF) as follows:
$$DF = DF
_{CCP} +  DF
_{CM} + DF

**Calculation of KCCP**

*Article 050A*


**1.** For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms
[OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2013:176:TOC).";, a CCP shall calculate KCCP as specified in paragraph 2 of this Article for all contracts and transactions it clears for all its clearing members falling within the coverage of the given default fund.


**2.** A CCP shall calculate the hypothetical capital (KCCP) as follows:
$$K
_{CCP} = 
\sum
_{i}\max
(EBRM
_{i} -  IM
_{i} -  DF
_{i};0) \times  RW  \times  captial ratio$$
where:
- **EBRMi**=exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member;
- **IMi**=the initial margin posted to the CCP by clearing member i;
- **DFi**=the pre-funded contribution of clearing member i;
- **RW**=a risk weight of 20 %;
- **capital ratio**=8 %.All values in the formula in the first subparagraph shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged.


**3.** A CCP shall undertake the calculation required by paragraph 2 at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those of its clearing members which are institutions.


**4.** For the purpose of paragraph 3, EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)the frequency and dates of the calculation laid down in paragraph 2;
- (b)the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of calculation and reporting than those referred to in point (a).EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 50b

**General rules for the calculation of KCCP**

*Article 050B*

For the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2), the following shall apply:
- (a)a CCP shall calculate the value of the exposures it has to its clearing members as follows:
- (i)for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the mark-to-market method laid down in Article 274 thereof;
- (ii)for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation. The exception set out in point (a) of Article 285(3) of that Regulation, shall not apply;
- (iii)for exposures arising from transactions not listed in Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which entails settlement risk only it shall calculate them in accordance with Part Three, Title V of that Regulation;
- (b)for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in Part Three, Title II of that Regulation;
- (c)when calculating the values referred to in point (a), the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
- (e)where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP;
- (f)where a CCP has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the CCP shall consider that initial margin as prefunded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;
- (h)when applying the Mark-to-Market Method as set out in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall replace the formula in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of that Regulation with the following:
$$PCE
_{red} = 0.15  \times  PCE
_{gross} + 0.85  \times  NGR  \times  PCE
_{gross}$$
where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of that Regulation and just before the variation margin is actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is gross replacement cost;
- (i)where a CCP cannot calculate the value of NGR as set out in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it shall:
- (i)notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities about its inability to calculate NGR and the reasons why it is unable to carry out the calculation;
- (ii)for a period of three months, it may use a value of NGR of 0,3 to perform the calculation of PCEred specified in point (h) of this Article;
- (j)where, at the end of the period specified in point (ii) of point (i), the CCP would still be unable to calculate the value of NGR, it shall do the following:
- (i)stop calculating KCCP;
- (ii)notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities that it has stopped calculating KCCP;
- (k)for the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure for options and swaptions in accordance with the Mark-to-Market Method specified in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall multiply the notional amount of the contract by the absolute value of the option's delta
$$
\left(δV  /  δp\right)$$
as set out in point (a) of Article 280(1) of that Regulation;
- (l)where a CCP has more than one default fund, it shall carry out the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2) for each default fund separately.
# Article 50c

**Reporting of information**

*Article 050C*


**1.** For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall report the following information to those of its clearing members which are institutions and to their competent authorities:
- (a)the hypothetical capital (KCCP);
- (b)the sum of pre-funded contributions (DFCM);
- (c)the amount of its pre-funded financial resources that it is required to use — by law or due to a contractual agreement with its clearing members — to cover its losses following the default of one or more of its clearing members before using the default fund contributions of the remaining clearing members (DFCCP);
- (d)the total number of its clearing members (N);
- (e)the concentration factor (β), as set out in Article 50d.Where the CCP has more than one default fund, it shall report the information in the first subparagraph for each default fund separately.


**2.** The CCP shall notify those of its clearing members which are institutions at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those clearing members.


**3.** EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following:
- (a)the uniform template for the purpose of the reporting specified in paragraph 1;
- (b)the frequency and dates of the reporting specified in paragraph 2;
- (c)the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of reporting than those referred to in point (b).EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.


# Article 50d

**Calculation of specific items to be reported by the CCP**

*Article 050D*

For the purposes of Article 50c, the following shall apply:
- (a)where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources in parallel to the pre-funded contributions of its clearing members in a manner that makes those resources equivalent to pre-funded contributions of a clearing member in terms of how they absorb the losses incurred by the CCP in the case of the default or insolvency of one or more of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those resources to DFCM;
- (b)where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources to cover its losses due to the default of one or more of its clearing members after it has depleted its default fund, but before it calls on the contractually committed contributions of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those additional financial resources 
$$
\left(DF
_{CCP}
^{a}\right)$$
to the total amount of pre-funded contributions (DF) as follows:
$$DF = DF
_{CCP} +  DF
_{CM} + DF
_{CCP}
^{a}$$
.
- (c)a CCP shall calculate the concentration factor (β) in accordance with the following formula:
$$β = 
\frac{PCE
_{red,1} +  PCE
_{red,2}}{
\sum
_{i}PCE
_{red,i}}$$
where:
- **PCEred,i**=the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with clearing member 
*i*;
- **PCEred,1**=the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the largest PCEred value;
- **PCEred,2**=the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the second largest PCEred value.
