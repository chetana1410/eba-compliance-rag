The institution shall consider the\nextent to which other forms of residual risk remain.\n4.\nThe requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not\napply for guarantees provided by institutions, central\ngovernments and central banks, and corporate entities which\nmeet the requirements laid down in Article 201(1)(g) if the\ninstitution has received permission to apply the Standardised\nApproach for exposures to such entities pursuant to Articles\n148 and 150. In this case the requirements of Chapter 4\nshall apply.\n5.\nFor retail guarantees, the requirements set out in para­\ngraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to the assignment of\nexposures to grades or pools, and the estimation of PD.\n6.\nEBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to\nspecify the conditions according to which competent authorities\nmay permit conditional guarantees to be recognised.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to\nthe Commission by 31 December 2014.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory\ntechnical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in\naccordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU)\nNo 1093/2010.",

An institution shall have a\nsystematic process for determining the situations for\nwhich external data shall be used and the methodologies\nused to incorporate the data in its measurement system;\n(b) an institution shall regularly review the conditions and\npractices for external data and shall document them and\nsubject them to periodic independent review.\n5.\nAn institution shall use scenario analysis of expert opinion\nin conjunction with external data to evaluate its exposure to\nhigh severity events.
