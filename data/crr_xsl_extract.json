Within one month of receipt of that notification, EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned and may indicate in that opinion, where necessary, whether they consider that the adjustments to risk weights and criteria are also recommended for other Member States. EBA and the ESRB shall publish the risk weights and criteria for exposures referred to in Articles 125 and 126 and Article 199(1), point (a), as implemented by the relevant authority.For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article may increase the risk weights laid down in Article 125(1), first subparagraph, Article 125(2), first subparagraph, Article 126(1), first subparagraph, or Article 126(2), first subparagraph, or impose stricter criteria than those set out in paragraph 3 of this Article for exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority. That authority shall not increase those risk weights to more than 150 %.For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article may also reduce the percentages of the property value referred to in Article 125(1) or Article 126(1) or the exposure-to-value percentages that define the exposure-to-value risk weight bucket set out in in Article 125(2), Table 1, or in Article 126(2), Table 1. The relevant authority shall ensure consistency across all exposure-to-value risk weight buckets, such that the risk weight of a lower exposure-to-value risk weight bucket is always lower or equal to the risk weight of an upper exposure-to-value risk weight bucket.\n\n"

Absent such effective protections, M for undrawn amounts shall be calculated as the sum of the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement and the remaining maturity of the purchase facility, where M shall be at least 90 days;\n- (f)for any instrument other than those referred to in this paragraph or when an institution is not in a position to calculate M as set out in point (a), M shall be the maximum remaining time, in years, that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, including the principal, interest, and fees, where M shall be at least one year;\n- (g)for institutions using the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6 of Chapter 6 to calculate the exposure values, M shall be calculated for exposures to which they apply this method and for which the maturity of the longest-dated contract contained in the netting set is greater than one year in accordance with the following formula:\n$$M = \\min\n(\n\\frac{\n\\sum\n_{k}Effective EE\n_{t\n_{k}} \\times  Δt\n_{k} \\times  df\n_{t\n_{k}} \\times  s\n_{t\n_{k}} + \n\\sum\n_{k} EE\n_{t\n_{k}} \\times  Δt\n_{k} \\times  df\n_{t\n_{k}} \\times \n\\left(1  -  s\n_{t\n_{k}}\\right)}{\n\\sum\n_{k}Effective EE\n_{t\n_{k}} \\times  Δt\n_{k} \\times  df\n_{t\n_{k}} \\times  s\n_{t\n_{k}}},5)$$\nwhere:\n- **\n$$S\n_{t\n_{k}}$$\n**=a dummy variable whose value at future period tk is equal to 0 if tk > 1 year and to 1 if tk ≤ 1;\n- **\n$$EE\n_{t\n_{k}}$$\n**=the expected exposure at the future period tk;\n- **\n$$Effective EE\n_{t\n_{k}}$$\n**=the effective expected exposure at the future period tk;\n- **\n$$df\n_{t\n_{k}}$$\n**=the risk-free discount factor for future time period tk;\n$$Δt\n_{k} = t\n_{k} - t\n_{k - 1}$$\n;\n- (h)an institution that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) may use, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, the effective credit duration estimated by the internal model as M.Subject to paragraph 2, for netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year the formula in point (a) shall apply;\n- (i)for institutions using the approaches referred to in Article 382a(1), point (a) or (b), to calculate the own funds requirements for the CVA risk of transactions with a given counterparty, M shall be no greater than 1 in the formula set out in Article 153(1), point (iii), for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty risk for the same transactions, as referred to in Article 92(4), point (a) or (g), as applicable;\n- (j)for revolving exposures, M shall be determined using the maximum contractual termination date of the facility; institutions shall not use the repayment date of the current drawing if that date is not the maximum contractual termination date of the facility.\n\n"

The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation;\n- (b)an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters. The institution's estimates shall be representative of long run experience;\n- (c)any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation periods referred to in Article 180(1)(h) and (2)(e), Article 181(1)(j) and (2), and Article 182(2) and (3) shall be taken into account. An institution's estimates shall reflect the implications of technical advances and new data and other information, as it becomes available. Institutions shall review their estimates when new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis;\n- (d)the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data was generated and other relevant characteristics shall be comparable with those of the institution's exposures and standards. The economic or market conditions that underlie the data shall be relevant to current and foreseeable conditions. The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification shall be sufficient to provide the institution with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates;\n- (e)for purchased receivables the estimates shall reflect all relevant information available to the purchasing institution regarding the quality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the purchasing institution, or by external sources. The purchasing institution shall evaluate any data relied upon which is provided by the seller;\n- (f)to overcome biases, an institution shall include appropriate adjustments in its estimates to the extent possible; after having included an appropriate adjustment, it shall add to its estimates a sufficient margin of conservatism that is related to the expected range of estimation errors; where methods and data are considered to be less satisfactory, the expected range of errors is larger, and the margin of conservatism shall be larger.Where institutions use different estimates for the calculation of risk weights and for internal purposes, it shall be documented and be reasonable. If institutions can demonstrate to their competent authorities that for data that have been collected prior to 1 January 2007 appropriate adjustments have been made to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default laid down in Article 178 or with loss, competent authorities may permit the institutions some flexibility in the application of the required standards for data.\n\n"

The internal models shall adequately explain historical price variation, capture both the magnitude and changes in the composition of potential concentrations, and be robust to adverse market environments. The population of risk exposures represented in the data used for estimation shall be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the institution's equity exposures;\n- (c)the internal model shall be appropriate for the risk profile and complexity of an institution's equity portfolio.

Internal models shall be fully integrated into the institution's risk management infrastructure if they are particularly used in measuring and assessing equity portfolio performance including the risk-adjusted performance, allocating economic capital to equity exposures and evaluating overall capital adequacy and the investment management process;\n- (b)established management systems, procedures, and control functions for ensuring the periodic and independent review of all elements of the internal modelling process, including approval of model revisions, vetting of model inputs, and review of model results, such as direct verification of risk computations. These reviews shall assess the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of model inputs and results and focus on both finding and limiting potential errors associated with known weaknesses and identifying unknown model weaknesses. Such reviews may be conducted by an internal independent unit, or by an independent external third party;\n- (c)adequate systems and procedures for monitoring investment limits and the risk exposures of equity exposures;\n- (d)the units responsible for the design and application of the model shall be functionally independent from the units responsible for managing individual investments;\n- (e)parties responsible for any aspect of the modelling process shall be adequately qualified.

Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that are secured by collateral in the form of securities;\n- Netting set, hedging sets, and related terms(4)\"netting set\" means a group of transactions between an institution and a single counterparty that is subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recognised under Section 7 and Chapter 4.Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement which is recognised under Section 7 shall be treated as its own netting set for the purposes of this Chapter.Under the Internal Model Method set out in Section 6, all netting sets with a single counterparty may be treated as a single netting set if negative simulated market values of the individual netting sets are set to 0 in the estimation of expected exposure (hereinafter referred to as \"EE\");(5)\"risk position\" means a risk number that is assigned to a transaction under the Standardised Method set out in Section5 following a predetermined algorithm;(6)\"hedging set\" means a group of transactions within a single netting set for which full or partial offsetting is allowed for determining the potential future exposure under the methods set out in Section 3 or 4 of this Chapter;(7)\"margin agreement\" means an agreement or provisions of an agreement under which one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an exposure of that second counterparty to the first counterparty exceeds a specified level;(7a)\"one way margin agreement\" means a margin agreement under which an institution is required to post variation margin to a counterparty but is not entitled to receive variation margin from that counterparty or vice-versa;(8)\"margin threshold\" means the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding before one party has the right to call for collateral;(9)\"margin period of risk\" means the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterparty until the transactions are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged;(10)\"effective maturity\" under the Internal Model Method for a netting set with maturity greater than one year means the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate of return, divided by the sum of expected exposure over one year in the netting set discounted at the risk-free rate.This effective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year;(11)\"cross-product netting\" means the inclusion of transactions of different product categories within the same netting set pursuant to the cross-product netting rules set out in this Chapter;(12)\"current market value\" or \"CMV\" means the net market value of all the transactions within a netting set gross of any collateral held or posted where positive and negative market values are netted in computing the CMV;(12a)\"net independent collateral amount\" or \"NICA\" means the sum of the volatility-adjusted value of net collateral received or posted, as applicable, to the netting set other than variation margin;\n- Distributions(13)\"distribution of market values\" means the forecast of the probability distribution of net market values of transactions within a netting set for a future date (the forecasting horizon), given the realised market value of those transactions at the date of the forecast;(14)\"distribution of exposures\" means the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero;(15)\"risk-neutral distribution\" means a distribution of market values or exposures over a future time period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities;(16)\"actual distribution\" means a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time period where the distribution is calculated using historic or realised values such as volatilities calculated using past price or rate changes;\n- Exposure measures and adjustments(17)\"current exposure\" means the larger of zero and the market value of a transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in insolvency or liquidation;(18)\"peak exposure\" means a high percentile of the distribution of exposures at particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set;(19)\"expected exposure\" (hereinafter referred to as \"EE\") means the average of the distribution of exposures at a particular future date before the longest maturity transaction in the netting set matures;(20)\"effective expected exposure at a specific date\" (hereinafter referred to as \"Effective EE\") means the maximum expected exposure that occurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as the greater of the expected exposure at that date or the effective expected exposure at any prior date;(21)\"expected positive exposure\" (hereinafter referred to as \"EPE\") means the weighted average over time of expected exposures, where the weights are the proportion of the entire time period that an individual expected exposure represents.When calculating the own funds requirement, institutions shall take the average over the first year or, if all the contracts within the netting set mature within less than one year, over the time period until the contract with the longest maturity in the netting set has matured;(22)\"effective expected positive exposure\" (hereinafter referred to as \"Effective EPE\") means the weighted average of effective expected exposure over the first year of a netting set or, if all the contracts within the netting set mature within less than one year, over the time period of the longest maturity contract in the netting set, where the weights are the proportion of the entire time period that an individual expected exposure represents;\n- CCR related risks(23)\"rollover risk\" means the amount by which EPE is understated when future transactions with a counterparty are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis.The additional exposure generated by those future transactions is not included in calculation of EPE;(24)\"counterparty\" for the purposes of Section 7 means any legal or natural person that enters into a netting agreement, and has the contractual capacity to do so;(25)\"contractual cross product netting agreement\" means a bilateral contractual agreement between an institution and a counterparty which creates a single legal obligation (based on netting of covered transactions) covering all bilateral master agreements and transactions belonging to different product categories that are included within the agreement;For the purposes of this definition, \"different product categories\" means:(a)repurchase transactions, securities and commodities lending and borrowing transactions;(b)margin lending transactions;(c)the contracts listed in Annex II;(26)\"payment leg\" means the payment agreed in an OTC derivative transaction with a linear risk profile which stipulates the exchange of a financial instrument for a payment.In the case of transactions that stipulate the exchange of payment against payment, those two payment legs shall consist of the contractually agreed gross payments, including the notional amount of the transaction."

The legal opinion shall refer to the applicable law:(i)the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is incorporated;(ii)if a branch of an undertaking is involved, which is located in a country other than that where the undertaking is incorporated, the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;(iii)the jurisdiction whose law governs the individual transactions included in the netting agreement;(iv)the jurisdiction whose law governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the contractual netting;\n- (c)credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure across transactions with each counterparty. This aggregation shall be factored into credit limit purposes and internal capital purposes;\n- (d)the contract shall not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor (i.e. walk-away clause).If any of the competent authorities are not satisfied that the contractual netting is legally valid and enforceable under the law of each of the jurisdictions referred to in point (b) the contractual netting agreement shall not be recognised as risk-reducing for either of the counterparties.

Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows:\n- (a)a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation;\n- (b)a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds;\n- (c)a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;\n- (d)in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk;\n- (e)a first-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.A -n-th-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less the n-1 reference entities with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.Where an n-th-to-default credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable.\n\n"
